I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Duncan Brown---I am incredibly lucky to have found an advisor like him. He has been a constant source of inspiration and support in the past five years, as a great scientist and generous mentor. I have benefited enormously from his extensive knowledge of gravitational-wave astronomy. I have learnt from him how any problem, regardless of its complexity level, can be understood and communicated effectively in simple steps. I am exceedingly grateful to him for his guidance and advice in all aspects of research, for giving me the freedom to explore a variety of research topics, and for numerous exciting opportunities---starting with participation in the analysis of the first gravitational-wave observations, during my second week in graduate school.

I have had a great time working in the Syracuse gravitational wave group. The informal, welcoming, and engaging environment encouraged in this group, made graduate school an experience that I will miss. I am grateful to Peter Saulson and Stefan Ballmer for thought-provoking discussions at group meetings, that helped in understanding the LIGO data, detectors, and detections better.

I am fortunate to have received the opportunity to collaborate with Jim Lattimer on analyses of gravitational-wave observations from neutron star mergers, and the work presented in Chapter 3 is a product of one of such projects. I am thankful for getting to learn so much about neutron star physics from him.

It has been a great pleasure working with Morgan Macleod, and our study is presented as Chapter 4. I am thankful to him for very nicely introducing me to hydrodynamics, for teaching me so much about common envelope physics, and for his exceptional patience throughout the project.

Thank you to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Ilya Mandel, for their guidance and collaboration on my project as a fellow at the Kavli summer program in astrophysics, 2017, and on the work that continued after the program.

It has been wonderful working with Daniel Siegel, and my work with him is presented in Chapter 5. I am thankful to him for kindly sharing so much knowledge that helped in broadening my understanding of electromagnetic counterpart aspects of neutron star mergers.

Many thanks to Collin Capano, Chris Biwer, and Alex Nitz. In the past five years, I have worked on many gravitational-wave data analysis and PyCBC code development projects in collaboration with them. I have learnt a great deal from their expertise, and I am thankful for the skills I have gathered working with them.

Progress on much of my research would have been difficult without Larne Pekowsky. I am indebted to him for helping me cross many computing hurdles, and for willing to very kindly answer any kind of computational question. I would like to thank Eric Sedore, for helping with computing resources, whenever I reached out.

Thanks to Daniel Finstad, Steven Reyes, Swetha Bhagwat, Amber Lenon, and Chaitanya Afle---for much-appreciated help and contributions, that have been vital for me in finding solutions to many problems. Thank you for being brilliant research group members.

I would like to thank T. J. Massinger, who generously extended a lot of help, and brought me up to speed with several aspects of projects I had to participate in, when I started graduate school. Thank you to Laura Nuttall for her helpful perspectives in several occasions. To all other members of the Syracuse gravitational wave group---Daniel Vander-Hyde, Derek Davis, Varun Srivastava, Ari Pedersen, Lorena Maga\~{n}a Zertuche, Fabian Maga\~{n}a-Sandoval, Thomas Vo, Nick Didio---thank you for all the fun and support.

Thank you to Rosa Wallace Everson, Andrea Antoni, Ingo Tews, and Edo Berger, for their crucial insights and contributions that helped in extracting valuable results from the projects that we collaborated on.

To Sukanta Bose---had I not got the chance to work with him back in India, I probably would not have been here. I am grateful to him for the research experience I gained, and for great advice on graduate school applications.

I would like to thank my defense committee members---Duncan Brown, Stefan Ballmer, Eric Coughlin, Scott Watson, Mitchell Soderberg, and Laura-Anne Minkoff-Zern---for taking the time to review and critique this dissertation.

For my graduate school research, I would like to gratefully acknowledge support from the NSF awards PHY-1707954 and PHY-1607169, the Inaugural Kathy '73 and Stan '72 Walters Endowed Fund for Science Research graduate fellowship, and the Research Excellence Doctoral Funding fellowship. A major part of the work presented here originated at several workshops and conferences, for which I would like to acknowledge the following. Work presented in Chapter 3 was stimulated by the rapid-response workshop ``Astrophysics from a Neutron Star Merger, 2017'' held at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP). Work presented in Chapter 4 originated at the ``Kavli Summer Program in Astrophysics, 2017'' supported by the Kavli Foundation and the Danish National Research Foundation, with hospitality provided by the Niels Bohr Institute. Work presented in Chapter 5 originated at the KITP program ``The New Era of Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astrophysics, 2019''. I thank the organizers of the programs mentioned above, and the respective institutes, for providing these amazing opportunities for research and collaboration.

Finally, I would like to thank my family---my parents and sister, to whom this thesis is dedicated. I thank my sister, Reshmi, for being a great source of strength, and my parents for their care, support, and time over the years.
