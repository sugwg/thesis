%Why test Gr

Many of the challenges of 21st-century physics involve our understanding of gravity. Open research problems include: the quantization of gravity \cite{QG1,QG2,QG3,QG4}, the black hole (BH) information paradox \cite{BHIP1,BHIP2,BHIP3,BHIP0,BHIP4}, building a unified theory for the fundamental forces \cite{GUT}, the fine-tuning problem in cosmology \cite{CosmoConstant1,CosmoConstant2} and understanding the nature of the dark energy \cite{DarkEnergy}. The general theory of relativity (GR) which describes the classical behaviour of gravitation \cite{OnGR}, has an elegant theoretical structure and has been tested experimentally in various regimes\cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1}. Our understanding of gravity seems to conflict with the framework of quantum mechanics \cite{GRvsQM3,GRvsQM1,GRvsQM2} and developing a quantum theory of gravity is an open problem.  Also, the fine-tuning problem in cosmology suggests that our understanding of gravity is incomplete at the large scales. Given the incomplete nature of GR, alternative descriptions of gravitation are being developed that aim to resolve one or more of these inconsistencies \cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1,ReviewAlternativeTheories2,ModifiedGravity1,ModifiedGravity2}. Experimental and observational tests of GR and other alternative theories of gravity are needed to understand the nature of gravity \cite{kipTGR1,kipTGR2,kipTGR3,TGRwithLISA}.

%Many of the challenges of 21st-century physics involve our understanding of gravity. For example, the quantization of gravity \cite{QG1,QG2,QG3,QG4}, the black hole information paradox \cite{BHIP1,BHIP2,BHIP3,BHIP0,BHIP4}, building a unified theory for the fundamental forces \cite{GUT}, the fine-tuning problem in cosmology \cite{CosmoConstant1,CosmoConstant2} and the understanding of the nature of the dark energy \cite{DarkEnergy} . The general theory of relativity (GR) describes the classical behaviour of gravitation \cite{OnGR}. Not only does GR have an elegant theoretical structure, but has also been validated by experiments in various regimes\cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1}. However, developing a theory of gravity on a quantum scale is still an avid problem. While our understanding of gravity seems conflicting with the framework of quantum mechanics \cite{GRvsQM3,GRvsQM1,GRvsQM2}, at large scales, we encounter the problem of fine-tuning of the cosmological constant. Given the incomplete nature of GR, alternative descriptions of gravitation are being developed that aim to resolve one or more of these inconsistencies \cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1,ReviewAlternativeTheories2,ModifiedGravity1,ModifiedGravity2}. Given the circumstance, experimental and observational lead seems imperative to further our understanding of Gravity. Experimental and observational tests of GR and other alternative theories of gravity are needed to truly understand the nature of gravity \cite{kipTGR1,kipTGR2,kipTGR3,TGRwithLISA}. 

%Intro to GW as a tool for TGR
Metric theories of gravity, predict propagating disturbances in space-time curvature known as the gravitational waves (GW) \cite{kipGWGR}. The details of these GWs depend on the exact underlying theory of gravity \cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1}.  A measurement of GW can help eliminate or constrain families of alternative theories of gravity and test GR. Observing GW signals from collision of two BHs \cite{CBCGW1, CBCGW2} can help us understand the nature of gravity.

The details of the nature of GWs depend on the exact underlying theory of gravity \cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1,kipGWGR}.  A measurement of GW can help eliminate or constrain families of alternative theories of gravity and validate GR. Observing GW signals from violent cosmic events like the supernovae explosions \cite{GwSupernovae1,GwSupernovae2} or collisions of two black holes \cite{CBCGW1, CBCGW2} can serve as a probe to understand the nature of gravity. Particularly, they provide an access to the dynamics in the strong field gravity around compact objects, where one expects to perceive the full complexity of the underlying theory of gravity \cite{0264-9381-33-5-054001}. This regime was inaccessible to experiments until the recent discovery of GWs by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) \cite{gw150914detection}. 


%Metric theories of gravity like GR, predict propagating disturbances in space-time curvature known as gravitational waves (GW) \cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1}. Violent cosmic events, like the supernovae explosion or collision of two black holes, can produce GWs that are loud enough for a GW observatory \cite{GRandGW} like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) to measure them. Observation of GWs can serve as an unsurpassed probe to understanding the nature of gravity, particularly the dynamics of strong field gravity around compact objects like black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS) [c.f. see section 5 of \cite{ReviewAlternativeTheories1}]. These compact binary systems are especially suitable for testing the validity of GR because it is in these strong field regimes that one expects to perceive the full complexity of the underlying theory of gravity \cite{0264-9381-33-5-054001}. 
     

%%% GW observation

The advent of GW astronomy offers an unprecedented method of testing GR and probing the nature of gravity \cite{kipGWGR}. Two GW signals from binary black hole (BBH) mergers (named as GW150914 and GW151226) were observed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave detectors (LIGO) in its first observing run with a statistical significance greater than 5 $\sigma$ \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016pea}. In the second observing run, a binary neutron star (BNS) event (named as GW170817) and three BBH events (named as GW170608, GW170814 and GW170104) were observed \cite{GW170608, GW170814,GW170104, GW170817}. With these observations, tests have been performed to understand the underlying theory of gravity; GR was seen to be consistent with the observed GWs \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src}. These observations also placed constraints on families of alternative theories of gravity  \cite{Yunes:2016jcc,TheLIGOScientific:2016src,2016arXiv160308955Y}. With the upgrades to the current LIGO facilities \cite{2015PhRvD..91f2005M} and the future ground-based missions like the Cosmic Explorer \cite{Evans:2016dc} and the Einstien Telescope \cite{0264-9381-28-9-094013}, complemented by the proposed space-based projects like the LISA \cite{LISA}, our ability to probe the nature of gravity will improve significantly.

With the existing LIGO's observations, GR has been subjected to various tests and alternative theory are already being constrained [c.f. \cite{Yunes:2016jcc,TheLIGOScientific:2016src,2016arXiv160308955Y} for details on testing GR using GW events]. 

% Structure of CBC waveform in light of probing different regimes of gravity
%The current LIGO facility can observe the last few minutes of a BBH merger. GWs emitted during a BBH coalescence can be roughly divided into three parts \cite{JCreightonBook}. Each of these parts contains imprints of gravitational dynamics at different length scales and strengths, therefore, offering a probe to test different regimes of gravity.  In the first phase is called the inspiral, the GW emitted has a slowly ramping frequency and amplitude (therefore, also referred to as GW chirp). In this phase, the two BH are far apart (compared to the size of the BHs) and are slowly (compared to the speed of light, c)  orbiting the common centre of mass. One can use a post-Newtonian (PN) approximations to computed the GWs emitted during the inspiral phase. This is the longest part of the signal for a stellar mass BBH merger and thus, the accumulated effects of the small differences in dynamics predicted by GR can be probed using this part of the signal.   This is followed by a violent plunge-merger phase which contains imprints of the nonlinear-strong field dynamics. In this stage, the two BHs merge and form a single distorted BH. The third part of the signal is called the RD.  Here, the newly formed BH settle down to its final stable configuration. In the GW signal, this part containts superposition of characterstic modes of a BH, called as quasi-normal-mode (QNM). The plunge-merger-RD signal contains imprints of dynamics in the strong field gravity and probes a length scales of the order of the BH horizon size.  

GWs emitted during a BBH coalescence can be roughly divided into three parts \cite{JCreightonBook}. Each of these parts contains imprints of gravitational dynamics at different length scales and strengths, therefore, testing different regimes of gravity.  In the first phase, called the inspiral, the GW emitted has increasing frequency and amplitude (referred to as GW chirp). In this phase, the two BH are far apart (compared to the size of the BH horizons) and are slowly (compared to the speed of light)  orbiting the common centre of mass. One can use a post-Newtonian (PN) approximations to computed the GWs emitted during the inspiral phase (this approximation assumes the limit $\frac{v}{c} << 1$). This part of the signal can be used to  study accumulated effects of the small differences in dynamics predicted by GR can be probed using this part of the signal. This phases is followed by a plunge-merger phase which contains imprints of the nonlinear-strong field dynamics. In this stage, the two BHs merge and form a single distorted BH. The third part of the signal is called the `ringdown' (RD).  During the RD, the newly formed BH settles down to its final stable configuration. The GWs radiated are a superposition of characteristic modes of a BH, called as quasi-normal-modes (QNM). The plunge-merger-RD signal contains imprints of dynamics in the strong field gravity and probes a length scales of the order of the BH horizon size.  



%Assuming that the underlying theory of gravity is GR, the Compact binary coalescences (CBC) emit GWs with a characteristic structure \cite{JCreightonBook}- when the two bodies are far apart and are slowly (compared to the speed of light, c) spiraling in, they produce the long chirping inspiral  signal, where both the frequency and the amplitude of the GW emitted increases with time. This is followed by a violent plunge-merger phase which contains imprints of the complex nonlinear-strong field dynamics predicted by GR. Then, there is a RD (RD) phase that corresponds to the distorted merged BH settling down to its final stable state.  


%%PPN and lead to RD
The GW signal from a BBH event offers powerful tests of GR. For example, using the inspiral signal in a parameterized-post-Newtonian (PPN) scheme [c.f chapter 4 of \cite{CliffWills_book}], one can experimentally constraint violations of many fundamental features of GR. Some of the feautres that one can test using this framework are the following: the amount of spatial curvature given a mass, the time delay effects, the Lorentz dispersion, the predicted nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, diffeomorphism and principle of equivalence and the conservation laws \cite{CliffWills_book}. Similarly, the merger-RD part of a CBC GW signal can be used to perform tests of GR in the strong field, and to explore nature of the compact objects \cite{Mazur:2000pn,misner1973gravitation,Dreyer,Gossan,Kamaretsos}. The tests that can be performed using  this part of the signal include the no-hair theorem test \cite{no-hair1,no-hair2}, the BH area increase test \cite{AreaIncreaseTheory1,AreaIncreaseTheory2}, direct observation of BH quasinormal mode spectrum \cite{lrr-1999-2,QNM-theory1 }, absence of echoes in post-merger signal \cite{echo1,echo2}. These tests are invaluable as they let us probe gravity in regimes that are inaccessible to experiments.

%One can device different tests with a GW signal from a CBC event to probe various features that are central to the framework of GR. For example, using the long inspiral signal in a parameterized-post-Newtonian (PPN) scheme [c.f chapter 4 of \cite{CliffWills_book}], One can experimentally constraint  violations of many fundamental features of GR like the amount of spatial curvature given a mass, the time delay effects, the Lorentz dispersion, the predicted nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, diffeomorphism and principle of equivalence, conservation laws etc (See the violin plot in Figure 7 and Table 1 of \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src} for details of how this scheme is used). Tests like this can be used to eliminate or constrain classes of alternative theories of gravity. Similarly, the merger-RD part of the CBC GW signal can be used to perform tests of GR focused on the strong field dynamics and nature of the compact objects \cite{Mazur:2000pn,misner1973gravitation,Dreyer,Gossan,Kamaretsos}- Eg. the no-hair theorem test \cite{no-hair1,no-hair2}, the BH area increase test \cite{AreaIncreaseTheory1,AreaIncreaseTheory2}, direct observation of BH quasinormal mode spectrum \cite{lrr-1999-2,QNM-theory1 }, absence of echoes in post-merger singal \cite{echo1,echo2} etc. These tests are invaluable and lets us probe gravity in regimes that were inaccessable by any other expriments.  

% Bringing people to RD land
To perform tests based on the RD part of the signal, one needs to be able to measure different modes present in the RD.  Unfortunately, the GW150914 has an SNR of only $\sim 8$ in the RD. The uncertainty in the measurement of the frequency of the dominant RD mode was $\sim 40$ Hz \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src}, which is not precise enough to perform a stringent test to understand the nature of the central compact object. Further, the BBH system that generated GW150914 signal comprised of nearly equal mass BHs. This produces a merger phase that excites primarily the dominant mode and suppresses sub-dominant mode excitations in the RD.  Although the RD in GW150914 signal is consistent with the prediction of GR \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src}, it could not be used to perform precision tests of strong field gravity. However, this signal gives us hope that for louder signals from binaries with a larger mass ratio, stringent tests of GR can be carried out using RD signals. 



%To perform tests based on the RD part of the signal, one needs to be able to measure different modes present in the RD.  Unfortunately, GW150914 was not loud enough to perform a detailed RD based tests of GR. The uncertainty in the measurement of the frequency of the dominant mode was $\sim 40$ Hz \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src}, which is imprecise to perform a stringent test. Further, the BBH system corresponding to the GW150914 signal comprised of nearly equal mass BHs. This produces a merger phase that essentially excites only the dominant mode and suppresses sub-dominant mode excitations in the RD.  Although the RD in GW150914 signal is consistent with the prediction of GR \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src}, it could not be used to perform precision tests of strong field gravity. However, this signal gives us hope that for a  louder signal from a skews mass ratio BBH system, which is very realistic with upgrades to LIGO or any future proposed detectors, stringent tests of GR can be carried out using RD signals. 

%Nonetheless, GW150914, the first GW detection by LIGO, was not loud enough to perform a detailed RD based tests of GR. The spread in the estimated frequency of the dominant mode present in the RD had a spread of $\sim 40$ Hz, which is too imprecise to perform a stringent test of GR. Moreover, GW150914 signal corresponds to a nearly equal mass progenitor BBH system and the symmetry of the initial system suppresses sub-dominant mode excitations in the RD. However, this signal gives us hope that for a slightly louder signal, which is very realistic with upgrades to LIGO or any future proposed detectors, very stringent tests of GR can be carried out using RD signals. 

%The primary focus of this thesis is on topics that are relevant for designing tests to probe the strong field GR using the RD part of a BBH merger. RD is a particularly appealing part of the BBH GW signal; it has an elegant analytical description offered by BH  perturbation theory and also is supplemented by insights offered by full non-linear numerical relativity framework. Although, RD signals contain a rich set of information about the strong field dynamics and nature of the compact object, the data analysis of these signals are far from being straightforward. Currently, the GW research community is in the phase of building robust tools to perform the RD based tests. In this thesis, we touch upon aspects of RD analysis, explored using a conglomeration of techniques developed in analytical perturbation theory, numerical relativity and GW data analysis. In Section \ref{sec:outlineThesis}, we outline the structure and flow of this thesis.

The primary focus of this thesis is to develop tools needed to probe the strong field gravity using the RD of a BBH merger. RD is a particularly appealing part of the BBH GW signal; it has an elegant analytical description offered by the BH  perturbation theory. To complement this,  since BBH mergers only deal with vacuum spacetime (unlike in the case of, say neutron star merges where it is hard to model complicated matter dynamics), numerical relativity can provide insights into the strong-field dynamics. Although, RD signals contain a rich set of information about the strong field dynamics and nature of the compact objects, the extraction of this information from of these signals are far from straightforward. Currently, the GW research community is building robust tools to test GR with ringdowns. In this thesis, we explore aspects of RD analysis,  using a conglomeration of techniques developed in analytical perturbation theory, NR and GW data analysis.

\section{On the discovery of GW150914}
Chapter 2 of this thesis summarizes the first direct detection of gravitational wave from a BBH merger, the GW150914.  It was remarkably fortunate that the first detection also happened to be extraordinary loud signal and that it allowed for visual inspection of the signal in the data with very basic filtering. We performed the first visualization of the GW signal in the raw data to check for visual consistency of the signal seen by the two detectors and the best-fit template. A more refined version of this analysis performed by the LIGO collaboration is presented in Figure 1 of the GW150914 discovery paper \cite{gw150914detection}. The astrophysical properties of GW150914 obtained by the LIGO collaboration using SEOBNRv3 are summarized in section \cite{PEonGW150915}.   


%Having witnessed the prestigious first discovery of GW signal from the BBH system as a member of the LIGO collaboration , Chapter 2 of this thesis is dedicated to summarizing the first discovery, GW150914 and the hope it sheds on testing the validity of GR. 

%Prior to the observing this golden first event, one would have never expected to discover a GW signal so loud that it can be visually seen with an extremely basic filtering of raw detector data. However, GW150914  happened to be an extraordinary loud signal and stood out in the detector data steam against the noisy background of the detector. As a part of the LIGO collaboration, I along with Prof. Stefan Ballmer performed some preliminary analysis of comparing the raw detector data with the GW waveform corresponding to the best-fit parameters of the BBH system reported by the search pipeline. This preliminary analysis is presented in section \ref{sec:dirrectComparision}. A more refined version of this analysis performed by the LIGO collaboration is presented in Figure 1 of the GW150914 discovery paper \ref{}.  

%Furthermore, as a part of the collaboration, I was involved in the review process of implementation of a waveform approximant that uses effective one body formalism and includes precession effects during the inspiral, called "SEOBNRv3" template family. This waveform family was used to improve the parameter estimation results of GW150914 \cite{}. The astrophysical properties of GW150914 obtained by the LIGO collaboration using SEOBNRv3 are summarized in section \ref{PEonGW150915}.   

\section{On ringdown and scales of perturbation}
Several RD-based tests of GR rely on verifying predictions of BH perturbation theory using the GW observations. One of the major challenges of performing these tests is to identify where in the post-merger signal one needs to start this analysis, i.e. how long after the peak of the waveform does the perturbative description hold? One naive argument is that one needs to at least wait till the scale of perturbation is smaller than the scale of the event horizon of the final BH formed for perturbation theory to hold. In Chapter 3, we set up two toy models to explore this concept: i) a system comprising of two point masses, and ii) a rotating tri-axial ellipsoid.  This work is primarily meant to develop an intuition towards the scales of perturbation that occurs in the source frame (close to BH) during the RD phase and to motivate the more precise study presented in Chapter 4. 



%Having seen a signal as loud as GW150914, it is only natural that one develops a reliable framework to extract the rich information present in the RD signals. Several RD based tests of GR relies on verifying prediction given by BH perturbation theory in the RD data of the GW observation. To do this, however, one of the major challenges is to identify where in the post-merger signal one needs to start this analysis (i.e) how long should we wait after the peak of the waveform before it admits a perturbative description. One naive argument could be that one needs to at least wait till the scale of perturbation is smaller than the scale of the event horizon of the final BH formed for perturbation theory to hold. In Chapter 3, we use two toy models to explore this concept - a) a system comprising of two point masses and b) a rotating tri-axial ellipsoid. We retro-engineer the systems such that they produce the observed GW signal and study the dynamics of these toy models. This work is primarily meant to develop an intuition towards the scales of perturbation that occurs in the source frame (close to BH) during the RD phase and to motivate the more concrete study presented in Chapter 4. 


%\subsection{On choosing the start time of binary black hole RD- Chapter4}
%In this chapter, we
%present an algorithmic method to analyze the choice of RD start time in
%the observed waveform. This method is based on determining how close the strong
%field is to a Kerr black hole (\textit{Kerrness}). Using numerical relativity
%simulations, we characterize the Kerrness of the strong-field region close to
%the black hole using a set of local, gauge-invariant geometric and algebraic
%conditions that measure local isometry to Kerr. We produce a map that
%%associates each time in the gravitational waveform with a value of each of
%these Kerrness measures; this map is produced by following outgoing null
%characteristics from the strong and near-field regions to the wave zone. Furthermore, we
%perform this analysis on a numerical relativity simulation with parameters
%consistent with GW150914- the first gravitational wave detection. 

%A particularly intersting result that  we find in this study is that the choice of RD start time of $3\,\mathrm{ms}$ after merger %used in the
%GW150914 study~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src} to test general relativity corresponds to a high dimensionless
%perturbation amplitude of $ \sim 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$ in the strong-field
%region. This suggests that in higher signal-to-noise detections, one would need
%to start analyzing the signal at a later time for studies that depend on the
%validity of black hole perturbation theory.

\section{On spectroscopic analysis of stellar mass black-hole mergers}
In Chapter 5, we investigate the prospects of ground-based detectors to perform a spectroscopic analysis of signals emitted during the RD of the final Kerr black-hole formed by a stellar mass binary black-hole merger. If we assume an optimistic rate of 240 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, about 3 events per year can be measured by Advanced LIGO. Further, upgrades to the existing LIGO detectors will increase the odds of measuring multiple RD modes significantly. New ground-based facilities such as Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer could measure multiple RD modes in about thousand events per year. We perform Monte-Carlo injections of $10^{6}$ binary black-hole mergers in a search volume defined by a sphere of radius 1500 Mpc centered at the detector, for various proposed ground-based detector models. We assume a uniform random distribution in component masses of the progenitor binaries, sky positions and orientations to investigate the fraction of the population that satisfy our criteria for detectability and resolvability of multiple RD modes. We investigate the detectability and resolvability of the sub-dominant modes $l=m=3$, $l=m=4$ and $l=2, m=1$. Our results indicate that the modes with $l=m=3$ and $l=2, m=1$ are the most promising candidates for sub-dominant mode measurability. We find that for stellar mass black-hole mergers, resolvability is not a limiting criteria for these modes. We emphasize that the measurability of the $l=2, m=1$ mode is not impeded by the resolvability criterion.

Our results indicate that the modes with $l=m=3$ and $l=2, m=1$ are the most promising candidates for sub-dominant mode measurability. We find that for stellar mass black-hole mergers, resolvability is not a limiting criteria for these modes. We emphasize that the measurability of the $l=2, m=1$ mode is not impeded by the resolvability criterion.

\section{On Bayesian parameter estimation for ringdown signals}
This chapter summarizes an ongoing work to develop a fully Bayesian PE framework, focused particularly on the RD. We intend to develop a systematic scheme and a robust code setup that can be applied to the detector data containing a BBH event to extract the QNM information from the RD. We use algorithms from the PyCBC \cite{Canton:2014ena,Usman:2015kfa,Nitz:2017svb} open source code library to perform the PE.  We use this set up to investigate the presence of a subdominant mode in RD. We find that if one assumes the knowledge of sky location of the source, then with an SNR of $\sim 18$ in RD, one can detect the presence of subdominant mode if the mass ratio of the BBH system is $\sim 2$. This is an interesting preliminary result because GW150914 had an SNR of 8 in its RD and advanced LIGO at its design sensitivity with be $\sim 3$ times more sensitive than when it observed GW15914. Therefore, in the next observing runs of LIGO, we stand an optimistic chance of detecting the presence of subdominant mode in BBH RD.

%In this chapter, I summarize my ongoing work in developing a fully Bayesian PE framework, focused particularly on the RD and present a proof-of-concept result. Further, we intend to develop a systematic scheme and a robust code setup that can be applied to the detector data containing a BBH event to extract the QNM information from the RD portion in the data. We use the code setup developed in the PyCBC open source code library to perform the PE. Furthermore, we use this set up to investigate the presence of a subdominant mode in RD and the results are presented in section \ref{presence-of-subdominatmode}. We find that if one assumes the knowledge of sky location of the source, then with an SNR of $\sim 12$ in RD, one might be able to detect the presence of subdominant mode. This is an interesting result because GW150914 had an SNR of 8 in its ringdoen and advanced LIGO at its design sensitivty with be $\sim 3$ times more sensitive than when it observed GW15914. Therefore, in the next observing runs of LIGO, we stand a optimistic chance of detecting the presence of subdominant mode in BBH RD. Note, however, that all the results in this section are preliminary.
