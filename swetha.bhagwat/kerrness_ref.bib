@book{BayesBooks2,
    abstract = {{"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--}},

abstract="Markov Chain Monte--Carlo (MCMC) is an increasingly popular method for obtaining information about distributions, especially for estimating posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. This article provides a very basic introduction to MCMC sampling. It describes what MCMC is, and what it can be used for, with simple illustrative examples. Highlighted are some of the benefits and limitations of MCMC sampling, as well as different approaches to circumventing the limitations most likely to trouble cognitive scientists.",

  abstract={Reviews sources of gravitational radiation that are likely to be detected by gravitational wave detectors now under development. The author first develops back-of-the-envelope formulae that are useful for estimating the strength of gravitational waves and their detectability, i.e. their signal-to-noise ratio in either bar detectors or laser interferometric detectors. It is shown that, provided one can filter wide-band data optimally for a class of signals, the detectability of a signal in a given detector depends only on its distance, its total energy within the detector's bandwidth and (for wide-band detectors) on the dominant frequency of the signal. The author then surveys the most plausible sources: supernovae, coalescing compact-object binaries, neutron stars either spinning down or being driven by accretion, and the stochastic background. Several important points emerge from comparing detectability. For example, at a given distance, supernovae and coalescing binaries give comparable signals in a typical bar detector, but coalescing binaries are potentially much easier to detect than supernovae using interferometers. As another example, if a supernova is detected, then the subsequent spindown of any newly-formed neutron star may be just as easy to detect, again using an interferometer. The review concludes with an extensive discussion of coalescing binaries, their likely event rates, detection rates and astrophysical importance.}

abstract="It is assumed that the singularities which occur in gravitational collapse are not visible from outside but are hidden behind an event horizon. This means that one can still predict the future outside the event horizon. A black hole on a spacelike surface is defined to be a connected component of the region of the surface bounded by the event horizon. As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes.",

 abstract = {We provide a detailed, introductory exposition of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a powerful Markov chain method to simulate multivariate distributions. A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

abstract="The status of experimental tests of general relativity and of theoretical frameworks for analyzing them is reviewed and updated. Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP) is well supported by experiments such as the E{\"o}tv{\"o}s experiment, tests of local Lorentz invariance and clock experiments. Ongoing tests of EEP and of the inverse square law are searching for new interactions arising from unification or quantum gravity. Tests of general relativity at the post-Newtonian level have reached high precision, including the light deflection, the Shapiro time delay, the perihelion advance of Mercury, the Nordtvedt effect in lunar motion, and frame-dragging. Gravitational wave damping has been detected in an amount that agrees with general relativity to better than half a percent using the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, and a growing family of other binary pulsar systems is yielding new tests, especially of strong-field effects. Current and future tests of relativity will center on strong gravity and gravitational waves.",

  abstract={The goal of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical origin. Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech–MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21 . With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.}

  abstract={We present an implementation of absorbing boundary conditions for the Einstein equations based on the recent work of Buchman and Sarbach. In this paper, we assume that spacetime may be linearized about Minkowski space close to the outer boundary, which is taken to be a coordinate sphere. We reformulate the boundary conditions as conditions on the gauge-invariant Regge–Wheeler–Zerilli scalars. Higher-order radial derivatives are eliminated by rewriting the boundary conditions as a system of ODEs for a set of auxiliary variables intrinsic to the boundary. From these we construct boundary data for a set of well-posed constraint-preserving boundary conditions for the Einstein equations in a first-order generalized harmonic formulation. This construction has direct applications to outer boundary conditions in simulations of isolated systems (e.g., binary black holes) as well as to the problem of Cauchy-perturbative matching. As a test problem for our numerical implementation, we consider linearized multipolar gravitational waves in TT gauge, with angular momentum numbers ℓ = 2 (Teukolsky waves), 3 and 4. We demonstrate that the perfectly absorbing boundary condition ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/26/7/075009/cqg300851ieqn1.gif] {\Hobc{L}} of order L = ℓ yields no spurious reflections to linear order in perturbation theory. This is in contrast to the lower-order absorbing boundary conditions ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/26/7/075009/cqg300851ieqn2.gif] {\Hobc{L}} with L < ℓ, which include the widely used freezing-Ψ 0 boundary condition that imposes the vanishing of the Newman–Penrose scalar Ψ 0 .}

 abstract = {This paper is divided into four parts. In part A, some general considerations about gravitational radiation are followed by a treatment of the scalar wave equation in the manner later to be applied to Einstein's field equations. In part B, a co-ordinate system is specified which is suitable for investigation of outgoing gravitational waves from an isolated axi-symmetric reflexion-symmetric system. The metric is expanded in negative powers of a suitably defined radial co-ordinate r, and the vacuum field equations are investigated in detail. It is shown that the flow of information to infinity is controlled by a single function of two variables called the news function. Together with initial conditions specified on a light cone, this function fully defines the behaviour of the system. No constraints of any kind are encountered. In part C, the transformations leaving the metric in the chosen form are determined. An investigation of the corresponding transformations in Minkowski space suggests that no generality is lost by assuming that the transformations, like the metric, may be expanded in negative powers of r. In part D, the mass of the system is defined in a way which in static metrics agrees with the usual definition. The principal result of the paper is then deduced, namely, that the mass of a system is constant if and only if there is no news; if there is news, the mass decreases monotonically so long as it continues. The linear approximation is next discussed, chiefly for its heuristic value, and employed in the analysis of a receiver for gravitational waves. Sandwich waves are constructed, and certain non-radiative but non-static solutions are discussed. This part concludes with a tentative classification of time-dependent solutions of the types considered.},

Progress is traced from the early stage of 1D feasibility studies to 2D axisymmetric codes that accurately simulate the oscillations and gravitational collapse of relativistic stars and to current 3D codes that provide pieces of a binary black hole spacetime. A prime application of characteristic evolution is to compute waveforms via Cauchy-characteristic matching, which is also reviewed.",

Numerical solution of Jaffe{\textquoteright}s characteristic equation indicates that for each l-pole there is an infinite number of damped Schwarzschild quasi-normal modes. The real parts of the corresponding frequencies are bounded, but the imaginary parts are not. Figures are presented that illustrate the trajectories the five least-damped of these frequencies trace in the complex frequency plane as the angular momentum of the black hole increases from zero to near the Kerr limit of maximum angular momentum per unit mass, a = M, where there is a coalescence of the more highly damped frequencies to the purely real value of the critical frequency for superradiant scattering.},

  abstract={General relativity has passed all solar system experiments and neutron star based tests, such as binary pulsar observations, with flying colors. A more exotic arena for testing general relativity is in systems that contain one or more black holes. Black holes are the most compact objects in the Universe, providing probes of the strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are motivated to study strong-field gravity since many theories give large deviations from general relativity only at large field strengths, while recovering the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can probe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using electromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent ways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black hole system. We then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general relativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of general relativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor gravitational degrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher curvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is four-dimensional. Altering a characteristic leads to a different extension of general relativity: (i) scalar–tensor theories, (ii) massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity, and (iv) theories with large extra dimensions. Within each theory, we describe black hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected constraints on each theory using black hole based tests of gravity. We close this review by listing some of the open problems in model-independent tests and within each specific theory.}

For the Schwarzschild black hole the problem reduces to one of finding such solutions for a one-dimensional wave equation (Zerilli's equation) for a potential which is positive everywhere and is of short-range. The notion of quasi-normal modes of such one-dimensional potential barriers is examined with two illustrative examples; and numerical solutions for Zerilli's potential are obtained by integrating the associated Riccati equation.},

  abstract={Assuming that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity in the strong-field limit, can gravitational-wave observations distinguish between black holes and other compact object sources? Alternatively, can gravitational-wave observations provide a test of one of the fundamental predictions of general relativity: the no-hair theorem? Here we describe a definitive test of the hypothesis that observations of damped, sinusoidal gravitational waves originate from a black hole or, alternatively, that nature respects the general relativistic no-hair theorem. For astrophysical black holes, which have a negligible charge-to-mass ratio, the black-hole quasi-normal mode spectrum is characterized entirely by the black-hole mass and angular momentum and is unique to black holes. In a different theory of gravity, or if the observed radiation arises from a different source (e.g., a neutron star, strange matter or boson star), the spectrum will be inconsistent with that predicted for general relativistic black holes. We give a statistical characterization of the consistency between the noisy observation and the theoretical predictions of general relativity and a demonstration, through simulation, of the effectiveness of the test for strong sources.}

  abstract={Advanced gravitational wave detectors, currently under construction, are expected to directly observe gravitational wave signals of astrophysical origin. The Einstein Telescope (ET), a third-generation gravitational wave detector, has been proposed in order to fully open up the emerging field of gravitational wave astronomy. In this paper we describe sensitivity models for ET and investigate potential limits imposed by fundamental noise sources. A special focus is set on evaluating the frequency band below 10 Hz where a complex mixture of seismic, gravity gradient, suspension thermal and radiation pressure noise dominates. We develop the most accurate sensitivity model, referred to as ET-D, for a third-generation detector so far, including the most relevant fundamental noise contributions.}
