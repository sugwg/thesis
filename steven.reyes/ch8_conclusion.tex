As we collect more gravitational wave events and dig into lower-threshold events (e.g. better analysis techniques) GW astronomy will let us learn about previously unstudied areas of astrophysics. And so on and so on. We have presented here a framework for better evaluating the statistical significance and inferences that we can learn about these events. These techniques provide an essential aspect of scientific learning, i.e. if I have many hypotheses about my data, what do my data teach me about these hypotheses. The tools of statistics---etc---etc.
