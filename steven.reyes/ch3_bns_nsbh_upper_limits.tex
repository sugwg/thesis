\section{Introduction}
Between \OoneSTART\ and \OoneEND\, the two advanced \ac{LIGO} detectors conducted their first observing run (\ac{O1}).
During \ac{O1}, two high-mass \ac{BBH} events
were identified with high confidence ($> 5 \sigma$): GW150914~\citep{Abbott:2016blz} and
GW151226~\citep{Abbott:2016nmj}. A third signal, LVT151012, was
also identified with \LVBLAHsignificance\ confidence~\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016pea, TheLIGOScientific:2016qqj}
In all three cases the component masses are confidently constrained to be above the $3.2M_\odot$ upper mass limit of \acp{NS} set
by theoretical considerations~\citep{Rhoades:1974fn,TheLIGOScientific:2016wfe}.
The details of these observations, investigations about the properties
of the observed \ac{BBH} mergers, and the astrophysical implications are explored
in~\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016wfe,Abbott:2016nhf,TheLIGOScientific:2016htt,TheLIGOScientific:2016src,TheLIGOScientific:2016pea, Abbott:2016izl}.

The search methods that successfully observed these \ac{BBH} mergers also target other types of compact
binary coalescences, specifically the inspiral and merger of \ac{BNS} systems and \ac{NSBH} systems. Such systems were considered
among the most promising candidates for an observation in \ac{O1}. For example, a simple calculation
prior to the start of O1 predicted 0.0005 - 4 detections of \ac{BNS}
signals during O1~\citep{Aasi:2013wya}.

n this paper we report on the search for \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} mergers in \ac{O1}. We have
searched for \ac{BNS} systems with component masses $\in [1,3] M_{\odot}$, component dimensionless
spins $< 0.05$ and spin orientations aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum.
We have searched for \ac{NSBH} systems with neutron star mass $\in [1,3] M_{\odot}$,
\ac{BH} mass $\in [2,99] M_{\odot}$ neutron star dimensionless spin magnitude $< 0.05$,
\ac{BH} dimensionless spin magnitude $<0.99$ and both spins
aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum.
No observation of
either \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} mergers was made in \ac{O1}. We explore the astrophysical implications
of this result, placing upper limits on the rates of such merger events in the
local Universe that
are roughly an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained with data from Initial \ac{LIGO}
and Initial Virgo~\citep{Abbott:2007kv,Acernese:2008zzf,Colaboration:2011np}.
We compare these updated rate limits to current predictions of \ac{BNS} and
\ac{NSBH} merger rates and explore how the non-detection of \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} systems in \ac{O1} can be used
to explore possible constraints of the opening angle of the radiation cone of short \acp{GRB},
assuming that short \ac{GRB} progenitors are \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} mergers.

The layout of this paper is as follows. In \S\,~\ref{sec:source_considerations} we describe
the motivation for our search parameter space. In \S\,~\ref{sec:search_description} we briefly
describe the search methodology, then describe the results of the search in \S\,~\ref{sec:search_results}.
We then discuss the constraints that can be placed on the rates of \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} mergers in \S\,~\ref{sec:rates}
and the astrophysical implications of the rates in \S\,~\ref{sec:astrophys_interp}. Finally, we conclude
in \S\,~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Source considerations}
\label{sec:source_considerations}

There are currently thousands of known NSs, most detected as pulsars
\citep{pulsarcat,Manchester:2004bp}. Of these, $\sim70$ are found in binary
systems and allow estimates of the NS mass
\citep{nsmassespage,Lattimer:2012nd,Ozel:2016oaf}.
Published mass estimates range from $1.0\pm0.17\,{M_{\odot}}$ \citep{Falanga:2015mra} to
$2.74\pm0.21\,{{M_{\odot}}}$ \citep{Freire:2007jd} although there is some uncertainty
in some of these measurements.
Considering only precise mass measurements from these observations one can set a lower bound
on the maximum possible neutron star mass of $2.01\pm 0.04\,{M_{\odot}}$~\citep{Antoniadis:2013pzd} and theoretical considerations
set an upper bound on the maximum possible neutron star mass of $2.9$--$3.2\,{M_{\odot}}$ \citep{Rhoades:1974fn,Kalogera:1996ci}.
The standard formation scenario of core-collapse supernovae restricts the birth
masses of neutron stars to be above $1.1$--$1.6\,{M_{\odot}}$
\citep{Ozel:2012ax,Lattimer:2012nd,Kiziltan:2013oja}.

Eight candidate \ac{BNS} systems allow mass measurements for individual
components, giving a much narrower mass distribution~\citep{Lorimer:2008se}. Masses are
reported between $1.0\,{{M_{\odot}}}$ and
$1.49\,{{M_{\odot}}}$~\citep{nsmassespage,Ozel:2016oaf}, and are consistent with an
underlying mass distribution of $(1.35 \pm
0.13)\,{{M_{\odot}}}$~\citep{Kiziltan:2010ct}.
These observational measurements assume masses are greater than $0.9{{M_{\odot}}}$.

The fastest spinning pulsar observed so far rotates with a frequency of 716\,Hz~\citep{Hessels:2006ze}. This
corresponds to a dimensionless spin $\chi = c | \mathbf{S} | / G m^2$ of roughly 0.4, where $m$ is the object's
mass and  $\mathbf{S}$ is the angular momentum.\footnote{Assuming a mass of $1.4{{M_\odot}}$ and
a moment of inertia $=J/\Omega$ of $1.5\times10^{45}$\,g\,cm$^2$; the exact moment of
inertia is dependent on the unknown \ac{NS} equation-of-state~\citep{Lattimer:2012nd}.} Such
rapid rotation rates likely require the NS to have been spun up through mass-transfer
from its companion. The fastest spinning pulsar in a confirmed \ac{BNS} system has a
spin frequency of 44\,Hz~\citep{Kramer:2009zza}, implying that dimensionless
spins for NS in \ac{BNS} systems are $\leq 0.04$~\citep{Brown:2012qf}. However,
recycled NS can have larger spins, and the potential \ac{BNS} pulsar J1807-2500B
\citep{Lynch:2011aa} has
a spin of 4.19\,ms, giving a dimensionless spin of up to
$\sim0.2$.\footnote{Calculated with a pulsar mass of $1.37{{M_\odot}}$ and a
high moment of inertia, $2\times10^{45}$\,g\,cm$^2$.}

Given these considerations, we search for \ac{BNS} systems with both masses
$\in [1,3] M_{\odot}$ and component dimensionless spins $< 0.05$. We have found
that \ac{BNS} systems with spins $< 0.4$ are generally still recovered well even
though they are not explicitly covered by our search space. Increasing the
search space to include \ac{BNS} systems with spins $< 0.4$ was found to
not improve overall search sensitivity~\citep{nitzthesis}.

\ac{NSBH} systems are thought to be efficiently formed in one of two ways: either
through the stellar evolution of field binaries or through dynamical
capture of a \ac{NS} by a \ac{BH}~\citep{Grindlay:2005ym,Sadowski:2007dz,Lee:2009ca,Benacquista:2011kv}.
Though no \ac{NSBH} systems are known to
exist, one likely progenitor has been observed, Cyg
X-3~\citep{Belczynski:2012jc}.

Measurements of galactic stellar mass
\acp{BH} in X-ray binaries yield \ac{BH} masses
$5 \le M_{\rm BH}/{M_{\odot}}\le 24$~\citep{Farr:2010tu,Ozel:2010su,Merloni:2008tj,Wiktorowicz:2013dua}.
Extragalactic high-mass X-ray binaries, such as IC10 X-1 and NGC300 X-1 suggest
BH masses of $20-30\,{M_{\odot}}$. Advanced \ac{LIGO} has observed two definitive \ac{BBH} systems and
constrained the masses of the 4 component \acp{BH} to $36_{-4}^{+5},
29_{-4}^{+4}, 14_{-4}^{+8}$ and $7.5_{-2.3}^{+2.3}\,M_{\odot}$, respectively, and
the masses of the two resulting \acp{BH} to $62_{-4}^{+4}$ and
$21_{-2}^{+6}\,M_{\odot}$. In addition if one assumes that the candidate \ac{BBH} merger LVT151012
was of astrophysical origin than its component \acp{BH} had masses constrained to $23_{-6}^{+16}$
and $13_{-5}^{+4}$ with a resulting \ac{BH} mass of $35_{-4}^{+14}$.
There is an apparent gap of \acp{BH} in the mass range $3$--$5\,
{M_{\odot}}$, which has been ascribed to the supernova explosion
mechanism~\citep{Belczynski:2011bn,Fryer:2011cx}. However, \acp{BH} formed from stellar
evolution may exist with masses down to $2\,{M_{\odot}}$, especially if they are formed
from matter accreted onto neutron stars \citep{O'Shaughnessy:2005qc}.
Population synthesis models typically allow for stellar-mass \ac{BH} up to
$\sim 80\text{--}100\,{M_{\odot}}$~\citep{Fryer:2011cx,Belczynski:2009xy,Dominik:2012kk};
stellar \acp{BH} with mass above $100\,{M_{\odot}}$ are also conceivable however
\citep{Belczynski:2014iua,deMink:2015yea}.

X-ray observations of accreting \acp{BH} indicate a broad
distribution of \ac{BH} spin~\citep{Miller:2009cw,Shafee:2005ef,
McClintock:2006xd,Liu:2008tk,Gou:2009ks,Davis:2006cm, Li:2004aq,Miller:2014aaa}.
Some \acp{BH} observed in X-ray binaries have very large dimensionless spins
(e.g Cygnus X-1 at $>0.95$ \citep{2012MNRAS.424..217F,Gou:2011nq}), while others
could have much lower spins ($\sim 0.1$)~\citep{McClintock:2011zq}. Measured
\ac{BH} spins in high-mass X-ray binary systems tend to have large values ($>0.85$), and
these systems are more likely to be progenitors of \ac{NSBH}
binaries~\citep{McClintock:2013vwa}.  Isolated \ac{BH} spins are only constrained
by the relativistic Kerr bound ${\chi} \leq 1$~\cite{misner2017gravitation}.
LIGO's observations of merging binary \ac{BH} systems yield
weak constraints on component spins \citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016wfe,Abbott:2016nmj,TheLIGOScientific:2016pea}.
The microquasar XTE J1550-564~\citep{Steiner:2011vr} and population synthesis
models~\citep{Fragos:2010tm} indicate small spin-orbit misalignment in
field binaries.
Dynamically formed \ac{NSBH} systems, in contrast, are expected to
have no correlation between the spins and the orbit.

We search for \ac{NSBH} systems with NS mass
$\in [1,3] M_{\odot}$, NS dimensionless spins $< 0.05$, BH mass $\in [2,99] M_{\odot}$
and BH spin magnitude $< 0.99$. Current search techniques are restricted to
waveform models where the spins are (anti-)aligned with the orbit~\citep{Messick:2016aqy,Usman:2015kfa},
although methods to extend this to generic spins are being explored~\citep{Harry:2016ijz}.
Nevertheless, aligned-spin searches have been shown to have good sensitivity
to systems with generic spin orientations in \ac{O1}~\citep{dal2015impact,Harry:2016ijz}. An
additional search for BBH systems with total mass greater than 100 $M_{\odot}$
is also being performed, the results of which will be reported in a future publication.

\section{Search Description}
\label{sec:search_description}

To observe compact binary coalescences in data taken from Advanced \ac{LIGO} we use
matched-filtering against models of compact binary merger \ac{GW} signals~\citep{Wainstein}.
Matched-filtering has long been the primary tool for modeled \ac{GW} searches~\citep{Abbott:2003pj, Colaboration:2011np}.
As the emitted \ac{GW} signal varies significantly over the range of masses and spins
in the \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} parameter space, the matched-filtering process must be repeated
over a large set of filter waveforms, or ``template bank''~\citep{Owen:1998dk}.
The ranges of masses considered in the searches are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:banks}.
The matched-filter process is conducted independently for each of the two \ac{LIGO} observatories before searching
for any potential \ac{GW} signals observed at both observatories with the
same masses and spins and within the expected light travel time delay.
A summary statistic is then assigned to each coincident event based on the estimated
rate of false alarms produced by the search background that would be more significant than the event.

\ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} mergers are prime candidates not only for observation with
\ac{GW} facilities, but also for coincident observation with \ac{EM}
observatories~\citep{Eichler:1989ve, Hansen:2000am, Narayan:1992iy, Li:1998bw, Nakar:2007yr, Metzger:2011bv, Nakar:2011cw, Berger:2013jza, Zhang:2013lta, Fong:2015oha}.
We have a long history of working with the Fermi, Swift and IPN \ac{GRB} teams
to perform sub-threshold searches of \ac{GW} data in a narrow window around
the time of observed \acp{GRB}~\citep{Abbott:2005yy, Abbott:2007rh, Abadie:2012bz, Briggs:2012ce}.
Such a search is currently being performed on \ac{O1} data and will be reported in a forthcoming
publication.
In \ac{O1} we also aimed to rapidly alert \ac{EM}
partners if a \ac{GW} observation was made~\citep{Abbott:2016gcq}.
Therefore it was critical for us to run ``online'' searches
to identify potential \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} mergers within a timescale of minutes after the data
is taken, to give \ac{EM} partners the best chance to perform a coincident
observation.

Nevertheless, analyses running with minute latency do not have access to full
data-characterization studies, which can take weeks to perform, or to data with the most complete
knowledge about calibration and associated uncertainties. Additionally, in rare
instances, online analyses may fail to analyse stretches of data due to computational failure. Therefore it is also
important to have an ``offline'' search, which performs the most sensitive search possible
for \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} sources.
We give here a brief description
of both the offline and online searches, referring to other works to give more details
when relevant.

\caption{\label{fig:beaming} Lower limit on the beaming angle of short
\acp{GRB}, as a function of the mass of the primary BH or
NS, $m_1$. We take the appropriate  90\% rate upper limit from this paper,
assume all short \acp{GRB} are produced by each case in turn, and assume all
have the same beaming angle $\theta_j$. The limit is calculated using an
observed short \ac{GRB} rate of
$10^{+20}_{-7}$Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$
and the ranges shown on the plot reflect the uncertainty in this observed rate.
For \ac{BNS}, $m_2$ comes from a Gaussian distribution centered on $1.35M_\odot$, and
for \ac{NSBH} it is fixed to $1.4M_\odot$.}
\end{figure}

We can compare our upper limits with rate predictions for compact object mergers
involving \acp{NS}, shown for \ac{BNS} in Figure~\ref{fig:ratecomparebns} and for \ac{NSBH} in
Figure~\ref{fig:ratecomparensbh}. A wide range of predictions derived from population
synthesis and from binary pulsar observations were reviewed in 2010 to produce rate estimates
for canonical
$1.4\,{{M_{\odot}}}$ \acp{NS} and $10\,{{M_{\odot}}}$ \acp{BH}~\citep{Abadie:2010cf}. We
additionally include some more recent estimates from population synthesis for
both \ac{NSBH} and \ac{BNS} \citep{Dominik:2014yma,Belczynski:2015tba,deMink:2015yea} and
binary pulsar observations for \ac{BNS} \citep{Kim:2013tca}.

We also compare our upper limits for \ac{NSBH} and \ac{BNS} systems to beaming-corrected
estimates of short \ac{GRB} rates in the local universe. Short \acp{GRB} are
considered likely to be produced by the merger of compact
binaries that include \acp{NS}, i.e. \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH}
systems~\citep{Berger:2013jza}. The rate of short \acp{GRB} can
predict the rate of progenitor mergers %\ac{BNS} and/or \ac{NSBH} systems
\citep{Coward:2012gn,Petrillo:2012ij,Siellez:2013hia,Fong:2015oha}.
For \ac{NSBH}, systems with small \ac{BH} masses are considered more likely to be able to
produce short \acp{GRB} (e.g.~ \citep{Duez:2009yz,Giacomazzo:2012zt,Pannarale:2015jia}), so we compare to our
$5 M_{\odot}$--$1.4 M_{\odot}$
\ac{NSBH} rate constraint. The observation of a kilonova is also considered to be an
indicator of a binary merger~\citep{Metzger:2011bv}, and an estimated kilonova rate
gives an additional lower bound on compact binary mergers~\citep{Jin:2015txa}.

Finally, some recent work has used the idea that mergers involving \acp{NS}
are the primary astrophysical source of r-process
elements \citep{1974ApJ...192L.145L,Qian:2007vq} to constrain the rate of such
mergers from nucleosynthesis \citep{Bauswein:2014vfa,Vangioni:2015ofa}, and we
include rates from \citep{Vangioni:2015ofa} for comparison.

While limits from \ac{O1} are not yet in tension with astrophysical models, scaling
our results to current expectations for advanced \ac{LIGO}'s next two observing runs,
O2 and O3 \citep{Aasi:2013wya}, suggests that significant constraints or
observations of \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} mergers are possible in the next two years.

Assuming that short \acp{GRB} are produced by \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH}, but
without using beaming angle estimates, we can constrain the beaming angle of the jet
of gamma rays emitted from these \acp{GRB} by comparing the rates of
\ac{BNS}/\ac{NSBH} mergers and the rates of
short \acp{GRB}~\citep{Chen:2012qh}.
For simplicity, we assume here that all short \acp{GRB} are associated with \ac{BNS}
or \ac{NSBH} mergers; the true fraction will
depend on the emission mechanism.  The short \ac{GRB} rate $R_{GRB}$, the merger rate
$R_{merger}$, and the beaming angle $\theta_j$ are then related by
%
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beaming}
\cos \theta_j = 1 - \frac{R_{\mathrm{GRB}}}{R_{\mathrm{merger}}}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

%
We take $R_{GRB}=10^{+20}_{-7}$Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$~\citep{Coward:2012gn,Nakar:2005bs}.
Figure~\ref{fig:beaming} shows the resulting \ac{GRB} beaming lower limits for the
90\% \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} rate upper limits.
With our assumption that all short \ac{GRB}s are produced by a single progenitor
class, the constraint is tighter for \ac{NSBH} with larger
\ac{BH} mass.
Observed \ac{GRB} beaming angles are in the range of
$3-25^{\circ}$~\citep{Fox:2005kv,Fong:2015oha,Grupe:2006uc,Soderberg:2006bn,2013ApJ...766...41S,2012ApJ...756...63M,2011A&A...531L...6N}.
Compared to the lower limit derived from our non-detection, these \ac{GRB}
beaming observations start to confine the fraction of \ac{GRB}s that can be
produced by higher-mass NSBH as progenitor systems.
Future constraints could also come from \ac{GRB} and \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} joint
detections~\citep{Dietz:2010eh,Regimbau:2014nxa, Clark:2014jpa}.
