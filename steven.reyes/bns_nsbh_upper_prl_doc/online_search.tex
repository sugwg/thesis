The online \ac{CBC} search of the \ac{O1} data also consisted of two analyses;
an online version of \gstlal\,\citep{Messick:2016aqy} and \mbta\,\citep{Adams:2015ulm}.
For detailed descriptions of the \mbta\ analysis we refer the reader to~\citep{Beauville:2007kp,Virgo:2011aa,Adams:2015ulm}.
The bank of waveform filters used by \gstlal\ up to December 23, 2015---and by
\mbta\ for the duration of \ac{O1}---targeted systems that contained at least one \ac{NS}.
Such systems are most likely to have an \ac{EM} counterpart, which would
be powered by the material from a disrupted \ac{NS}.
These sets of waveform filters were constructed using methods described
in~\citep{Brown:2012qf,Harry:2013tca,Pannarale:2014rea}. \gstlal\ chose to cover systems with component masses of
$m_1 \in [1,16] M_{\odot}; m_2 \in [1,2.8] M_{\odot}$ and \mbta\ covered $m_1, m_2 \in [1,12] M_{\odot}$ with
a limit on chirp mass $\mathcal{M} < 5\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:banks}). In \gstlal\ component spins were
limited to $\chi_{i} < 0.05$ for $m_{i} < 2.8\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $\chi_{i} < 1$ otherwise, for
\mbta\ $\chi_{i} < 0.05$ for $m_{i} < 2\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $\chi_{i} < 1$ otherwise.
\gstlal\ also chose to limit the template bank to include only systems for which it is possible for
a \ac{NS} to have disrupted during the late inspiral using constraints described
in~\citep{Pannarale:2014rea}. For the \mbta\ search the waveform filters were modelled using the
``TaylorT4'' time-domain, post-Newtonian inspiral approximant~\citep{Buonanno:2009zt}.
For \gstlal\
the TaylorF2 frequency-domain, post-Newtonian waveform approximant was
used~\citep{Arun:2008kb,Bohe:2013cla,Blanchet:2013haa,Bohe:2015ana,Mishra:2016whh}.
All waveform models used in this paper are publicly available
in the \texttt{lalsimulation} repository~\citep{LAL}.\footnote{The
  internal \texttt{lalsimulation} names for the waveforms used as filters
  described in this work are ``TaylorF2'' for the frequency-domain post-Newtonian
  approximant, ``SpinTaylorT4'' for the time-domain
  approximant used by \mbta\ and ``SEOBNRv2\_ROM\_DoubleSpin'' for the
  aligned-spin effective one body waveform.
  In addition, for calculation of rate estimates describe in Section \ref{sec:rates},
  the ``SpinTaylorT4'' model is used to simulate BNS signals and
  ``SEOBNRv3'' is used to simulate NSBH signals.}

After December 23, 2015, and triggered by the discovery of GW150914, the \gstlal\
analysis was extended to cover the same search space---using
the same set of waveform filters---as the offline search~\citep{Capano:2016dsf,TheLIGOScientific:2016pea}.
