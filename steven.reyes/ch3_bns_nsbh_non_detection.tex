The offline search, targeting \ac{BBH} as well as \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH} mergers, identified
two signals with $> 5 \sigma$ confidence in the \ac{O1} dataset~\citep{Abbott:2016blz,Abbott:2016nmj}. A third signal was
also identified with \LVBLAHsignificance\ confidence~\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016pea, TheLIGOScientific:2016qqj}. Subsequent
parameter inference on all three of these events has determined that, to very high
confidence, they were not produced by a \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} merger~\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016wfe, TheLIGOScientific:2016pea}. No other events
are significant with respect to the noise background in the offline search~\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016pea}, and
we therefore state that no \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} mergers were observed.
