\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
The discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 \citep{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa} has given us a new way to explore the physics of neutron stars. Recent studies have measured the star's tidal deformability and placed constraints on the equation of state of the neutron stars~\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa,Tews:2018iwm,Most:2018eaw,Raithel:2018ncd,de2018tidal,Abbott:2018exr,Abbott:2018wiz,Radice:2018ozg,LIGOScientific:2019eut,Capano:2019eae}.
\cite{Weinberg:2013pbi} have suggested that the star's tidal deformation can induce nonresonant and nonlinear daughter wave excitations in $p$- and $g$-modes of the neutron stars via a quasi-static instability. This instability would remove energy from a binary system and possibly affect the phase evolution of the gravitational waves radiated during the inspiral. Although \cite{Venumadhav:2013nla} concluded that there is no quasi-static instability and hence no effect on the inspiral, \cite{Weinberg:2015pxa} claims that the instability can rapidly drive modes to significant energies well before the binary merges. However, the details of the instability saturation are unknown and so the size of the effect of the $p$-$g$ mode coupling on the gravitational-waveform is not known~\citep{Weinberg:2015pxa}. The discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 by Advanced LIGO and Virgo provides an opportunity to determine if there is evidence for nonlinear tides from $p$-$g$ mode coupling during the binary inspiral.

Since the physics of the $p$-$g$ mode instability is uncertain, \cite{Essick:2016tkn} developed a parameterized model of the energy loss due to nonlinear tides. This model is parameterized by the amplitude and frequency dependence of the energy loss, and the gravitational-wave frequency at which the instability saturates and the energy loss turns on. For plausible assumptions about the saturation, \cite{Essick:2016tkn} concluded that $> 70\%$ of binary merger signals could be missed if only point-particle waveforms are used, and that neglecting nonlinear tidal dynamics may significantly bias the measured parameters of the binary. Bayesian inference can be used to place constraints on nonlinear tides during the inspiral of GW170817. An analysis by \cite{abbott2019constraining} computed Bayes factors that investigate whether the GW170817 signal is more likely to have been generated by a model which includes nonlinear tides or one which does not. \cite{abbott2019constraining} find a Bayes factor of order unity, and conclude that the GW1701817 signal is consistent with both a model that neglects nonlinear tides and with a model that includes energy loss from a broad range of $p$-$g$ mode parameters. However, the prior space used in this analysis includes a large region of  parameter space where the amplitude of the effect produces a gravitational-wave phase shift that is extremely small. In this case, a waveform that includes $p$-$g$ mode parameters will have a likelihood that is identical to the likelihood of the waveform without the $p$-$g$ mode instability. The $p$-$g$ mode model extends the standard waveform model by adding additional parameters that describe the nonlinear tidal effects. However, when including new parameters in a hypothesis if the likelihood does not vary across large portions of the prior volume for these new parameters relative to the likelihood of the original model, then the Bayes factor will not penalize this additional prior volume, nor will it penalize any extraneous parameters in the model (see e.g. \cite{kass1995bayes,hobson2010bayesian}). We examine prior space of $p$-$g$ model used by \cite{abbott2019constraining} and find that although the $p$-$g$ model model contains regions that are not consistent with the standard model, there are large regions of the prior space where the likelihood is high because the $p$-$g$ mode model is degenerate with the standard model. These regions of prior space dominate the evidence and hence the Bayes factor neither favors nor disfavors the inclusion of $p$-$g$ mode parameters.

We investigate a variety of different prior distributions on the $p$-$g$ mode parameters beginning with a prior distribution that is similar to that tested in~\cite{abbott2019constraining} and includes large regions of the parameter space that produce a negligible gravitational-wave phase shift. When comparing the evidence for this model with the standard waveform model used by \cite{de2018tidal} we find a Bayes factor of order unity, as expected. We then investigate a prior distribution in which the $p$-$g$ mode instability parameters are constrained to induce a phase shift to the waveform that is greater than $0.1$ radians. This phase shift is calculated from the time the waveform enters the sensitive band of the detector to the time when the waveform reaches the innermost stable circular orbit. We choose this threshold to exclude trivial regions of the parameter space that produce a non-measurable effect. However, we again find a Bayes factor of order unity when compared to the model hypothesis that does not model the $p$-$g$ mode instability. Investigation of these results showed that this is due to parameter degeneracies between the $p$-$g$ mode model and the intrinsic parameters of the standard waveform model.

Finally, we reduce the prior space to contain only the regions where the $p$-$g$ mode waveform is not degenerate with the standard model by computing the fitting factor~\citep{Apostolatos:1995pj} of $p$-$g$ signals against a set of standard waveforms. We do this to restrict the region of parameter space to that where the $p$-$g$ effect is \emph{measurably} distinct from a model that neglects nonlinear tides. We calculate the Bayes factor as a function of the fitting factor. We find that as the $p$-$g$ mode parameter space is restricted to exclude regions that have a high fitting factor with standard waveforms, the Bayes factor decreases significantly. Regions of the nonlinear tide parameter space that have a fitting factor of less than 99\% (98.5\%) are strongly disfavored by a Bayes factor of 15 (25).  While certain prior distributions of $p$-$g$ mode parameters are consistent with the data, we find that these distributions are ones that contain large regions of non-measurable parameter space either because the effect produced is too small to measure, or the effect is degenerate with other parameters of the standard model. We conclude that the consistency of the GW170817 signal with the model of \cite{Essick:2016tkn} is due to degeneracies and that regions where non-linear tides produce a measurable effect are strongly disfavored.

\section{A Waveform Model for Nonlinear Tides from a $p$-$g$ mode instability}
\label{sec:waveform}

As two neutron stars orbit each other, they lose orbital energy $E_\mathrm{orbital}$ due to gravitational radiation $\dot{E}_{GW}$. The gravitational waveform during the inspiral is well modeled by post-Newtonian theory~(see e.g. \cite{Blanchet:2013haa}).  The effect of the $p$-$g$ mode instability is to dissipate orbital energy by removing energy from the tidal bulge of the stars~\citep{Weinberg:2013pbi,Weinberg:2015pxa,Essick:2016tkn}. Once unstable, the coupled $p$- and $g$-modes are continuously driven by the tides, giving rise to an extra energy dissipation $\dot{E}_{NL}$ for each star in the standard energy-balance equation~\citep{Peters:1963ux} 
\begin{equation}
\dot{E}_\mathrm{orbital} = -\dot{E}_\mathrm{GW} - \dot{E}^1_\mathrm{NL} - \dot{E}^2_\mathrm{NL}.
\label{eqn:energy_bal}
\end{equation}
Since the details of how the nonlinear tides extract energy from the orbit is not known, \cite{Essick:2016tkn} constructed a simple model of the energy loss and calculated plausible values for the model's parameters. In this model, the rate of orbital energy lost during the inspiral is modified by 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:energy_nl}
\dot{E}_\mathrm{NL} \propto A f^{n+2} \Theta (f - f_0),
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a dimensionless constant that determines the overall amplitude of the energy loss, $n$ determines the frequency dependence of the energy loss, and $f_0$ is the frequency at which the $p$-$g$ mode instability saturation occurs and the effect turns on. By solving Eq.~(\ref{eqn:energy_bal}), \cite{Essick:2016tkn} computed the leading order effect of the nonlinear tides on the gravitational-wave phase as a function of $A$, $n$, and $f_0$. In this analysis, they allowed each star to have independent values of $A$, $f_0$, and $n$, but found that the energy loss due to nonlinear tides depends relatively weakly on the binary's mass ratio. Hence, they consider a model that performs a Taylor expansion in the binary's component mass~\citep{DelPozzo:2013ala} and include only the leading order terms in the binary's phase evolution. Given this, we parameterize our nonlinear tide waveform with a single set of parameters $A$, $n$, and $f_0$, by setting $\dot{E}^1_\mathrm{NL} = \dot{E}^2_\mathrm{NL}$. We  keep only the leading order nonlinear tide terms when we obtain the quantities $t(f)$ and $\phi(f)$ used to compute the stationary phase approximation~\citep{Sathyaprakash:1991mt,Droz:1999qx,Lindblom:2008cm}. This approach is reasonable for GW170817, since both neutron stars have similar masses and radii~\citep{de2018tidal}.

The dependence of $A$, $n$, and $f_0$ on the star's physical parameters is not known~\citep{Weinberg:2015pxa}. \cite{Essick:2016tkn} estimate that plausible parameter ranges are $A \lesssim 10^{-6}$, $0 \lesssim n \lesssim 2$, and $30 \lesssim f_0 \lesssim 80$ Hz. \cite{Zhou:2018tvc} found that the frequency at which the instability begins to grow is equation-of-state dependent and can occur at gravitational-wave frequencies as high as $700$~Hz. \cite{Andersson:2017iav} suggest that the instability may only act during the late stages of inspiral, (above $300$~Hz), otherwise the large energy dissipation will cause the temperature of the neutron stars to be very large. 

In this chapter, we compare two models for the gravitational waves radiated by GW170817. The first is the standard restricted stationary-phase approximation to the Fourier transform of the gravitational waveform $\tilde{h}(f)$, known as the TaylorF2 waveform~\citep{Sathyaprakash:1991mt}. We begin with the same waveform model used by \cite{de2018tidal}, which is accurate to 3.5 PN order in the orbital phase, 2.0 PN order in spin-spin, self-spin and quadrupole-monopole interactions, 3.5 PN order in spin-orbit coupling, and includes the leading and next-to-leading order corrections from the star's tidal deformability~\citep{Kidder:1992fr,Blanchet:1995ez,Blanchet:2004ek,Buonanno:2009zt,Arun:2008kb,Marsat:2013caa,Bohe:2013cla,Bohe:2015ana,Mikoczi:2005dn, Flanagan:2007ix,Vines:2011ud}. We then construct a second model that adds the leading order effect of nonlinear tides computed using the model of \cite{Essick:2016tkn}. Below we detail the construction of this second model, by computing the leading order nonlinear tidal Fourier phase term for the TaylorF2 model as well as the leading order nonlinear tidal energy dissipation.

We begin our derivation with the energy balance equation presented in \cite{Essick:2016tkn},
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_app:energy_bal}
\dot{E}_{orbit} = -\dot{E}_{GW} - 2 \dot{E}_{NL},
\end{equation}
for $\dot{E}_{orbit}$ being the rate of energy loss of a quasi-circular orbit, $\dot{E}_{GW}$ being the energy rate loss due to gravitational waves in the point-particle model, and $\dot{E}_{NL}$ being the rate of energy loss from each star's $p$-$g$ mode instability. We assume that the energy losses from $p$-$g$ mode instability will be comparable in each star. The $\dot{E}$ notation refers to the derivative of the energy with respect to time. We now give explicit values to these energy rates with respect to gravitational wave frequency, $f$.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:e_orbit_decay}
\dot{E}_{\mathrm{orbit}} = - \frac{G^{2/3} \pi^{2/3} \mathcal{M}^{5/3} \dot{f}}{3 f^{1/3}}
\end{equation}
is the orbital energy decay. The gravitational wave energy rate as a function of frequency is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:e_gw_decay}
\dot{E}_{\mathrm{GW}} = \frac{32 G^{7/3} \left(\pi \mathcal{M} f\right)^{10/3}}{5 c^5}.
\end{equation}
Finally, we take from \cite{Essick:2016tkn} that each star, indexed by $i$, should have an energy dissipation rate of
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:e_nl_decay}
\dot{E}_{\mathrm{NL}, i} = \frac{(2G m_i)^{2/3}m_1 m_2}{M} (\pi f_{\mathrm{ref}})^{5/3} A \left (\frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n+2} \Theta(f - f_0) 
\end{equation}
where $m_i$ is the component mass of the neutron star, $M$ is the total mass ($M$ = $m_1$ + $m_2$). Assuming that the binaries have equal mass in Eq..~(\ref{eqn:e_nl_decay}) and solving for $\dot{f}$, we arrive at the following expression
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:f_dot}
\frac{df}{dt} =  \pi \left ( \frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{7/3} \, f_{\mathrm{ref}}^2 \times \left [ \frac{96}{5} \left ( \frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3}\right )^{5/3} \left (\frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{4/3} + 6 A \left (\frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n} \Theta(f - f_0) \right ].
\end{equation}

Given Eq.~\ref{eqn:f_dot}, we can now consider a time domain signal of the form, $h(t)$ = $A(t)$ $e^{\phi(t)}$, where $h(t)$ is the strain of the gravitational wave at some time t before merger, $A(t)$ is the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain at that same time, and $\phi(t)$ is the orbital phase of the binaries\cite{maggiore2008gravitational}. This stationary phase approximation lets us approximate the Fourier transform of this time domain signal as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SPA}
\tilde{h}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t) dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(t) e^{-2\pi i ft + \phi(t)} df \approx \tilde{B}(f) e^{-i\Psi(f)}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{B}(f)$ is the Fourier amplitude of the frequency domain waveform, and $\Psi(f)$ is the Fourier phase of the frequency domain waveform. We express this Fourier phase as 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SPA_Phase}
\Psi(f) = 2\pi f t(f) - \phi(f)..
\end{equation}

One can derive $t(f)$ by solving the differential equation given in Eq..~(\ref{eqn:f_dot}). For convenience we redefine and reorganize this differential equation as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:unitless_f_dot}
\int_{t_c}^t dt = \int_{x_c}^{x}  \frac{f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{\kappa} \frac{x^{-7/3} dx}{\alpha x^{4/3} +  \Theta(x - x_0) \beta x^n}
\end{equation}
where $x$ = $f / f_{\mathrm{ref}}$, $dx$ = $df / f_{\mathrm{ref}}$, $x_0$ = $f_0 / f_{\mathrm{ref}}$, and $\kappa$ = $\pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}^2$. The integration bounds are the time of coalescence ($t_c$ = 0) to some time $t$ prior to merger, and from dimensionless frequency at coalescence ($x_c$ = $f_c / f_{\mathrm{ref}}$ = $\infty$) to dimensionless frequency $x$ prior to merger. Here $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are given by the following expressions:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{96}{5} \left ( \frac{G \pi \mathcal{M} f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right )^{5/3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta = 6 A
\end{equation}

We can simplify the differential equation given in Eqn.~(\ref{eqn:unitless_f_dot}) if we assume that the point particle gravitational wave contribution dominates ($\alpha$ $\gg$ $\beta$), we take a power series expansion assuming large $\alpha$ relative to $\beta$. This gives to lowest order in $\beta$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dt_app}
\int_{t_c}^t dt = \int_{x_c}^{x} \frac{f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{\kappa} \left (\frac{1}{\alpha x^{11/3}} +  \frac{\Theta(x - x_0) \beta x^{n-5}}{\alpha^2 (n-5)} \right ) dx
\end{equation}
The first term in Eq..~(\ref{eqn:dt_app}) corresponds to the lowest order post-Newtonian result from the point-particle model. Integrating the second term and respecting the $\Theta(x-x_0)$ so as to align the waveform at merger ($t=0$), we arrive at the leading order contribution of $p$-$g$ mode instability to $t(f)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:t_of_f_app}
\Delta t(f) = \left \{
              \begin{array}{ll}
              \frac{-25}{1536} \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{A}{n-4} \left ( \frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right )^{-10/3}\left ( \frac{f_0}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n-4}, &\quad   f < f_0 \\ \\
              \frac{-25}{1536} \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{A}{n-4} \left ( \frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right )^{-10/3}\left ( \frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n-4}, &\quad  f \ge f_0
              \end{array}
              \right.
\end{equation}

Following a similar approach we can calculate $\phi(f)$ via $d\phi$ = $2 \pi f dt$ = $2 \pi (f/\dot{f}) df$. Taking the same power series expansion, integrating so that the waveform coalesces at $t = 0$, and examining the leading order contribution from $p$-$g$ mode instability we arrive at
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dphi_app}
\int_{\phi_c}^\phi d\phi = \int_{x_c}^{x} \frac{f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{\kappa} \left (\frac{1}{\alpha x^{8/3}} +  \frac{\Theta(x - x_0) \beta x^{n-4}}{\alpha^2 (n-4)} \right ) dx.
\end{equation}
Integrating this through from $\phi_c$, the phase at coalescence, to some earlier $\phi$ prior to coalescence, and integrating the right hand side of Eq..~(\ref{eqn:dphi_app}) we get the lowest order post-Newtonian correction to the phase for the point particle model in integrating the $x^{-8/3}$ term and the lowest order correction due to $p$-$g$ mode instability in integrating the $x^{n-4}$ term. Thus the correction to the gravitational wave phase due to $p$-$g$ mode instability is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:delta_phi_app}
\Delta \phi(f) = \left \{
                     \begin{array}{ll}
                     \frac{-25}{768} \frac{A}{n-3} \left ( \frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right )^{-10/3} \left ( \frac{f_0}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n-3}, &\quad  f < f_0 \\ \\
                     \frac{-25}{768} \frac{A}{n-3} \left ( \frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right )^{-10/3} \left ( \frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n-3}, &\quad  f \ge f_0
                     \end{array}
                     \right.
\end{equation}

Finally, we can express the Fourier phase in terms of Eq.s.~(\ref{eqn:t_of_f_app}) and (\ref{eqn:delta_phi_app}) as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fourier_phase_app}
\Delta \Psi(f) = \left \{
                     \begin{array}{ll}
                      2 \pi f \Delta t(f_0) - \Delta \phi(f_0), &\quad  f < f_0 \\ \\
                      2 \pi f \Delta t(f) - \Delta \phi(f), &\quad f \ge f_0
                     \end{array}
                     \right.
\end{equation}
which fully expanded becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fourier_phase_final_app}
\Delta \Psi(f) = \left \{
                     \begin{array}{ll}
                      - \frac{25}{768} A \left ( \frac{f_0}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right)^{n-3} \left [ \frac{f}{f_0}\frac{1}{n-4} - \frac{1}{n-3} \right], &\quad  f < f_0 \\ \\
                      - \frac{25}{768} A \left (\frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right )^{-10/3} \left ( \frac{f}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right )^{n-3} \left [\frac{1}{n-4} - \frac{1}{n-3} \right ],  &\quad  f \ge f_0
                      \end{array}
                 \right.
\end{equation}
Here, $f_\mathrm{ref}$ is a reference frequency which we set to $100$~Hz following \cite{Essick:2016tkn}, $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\mathcal{M} = (m_1 m_2)^{3/5}/(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}$ is the chirp mass of the binary.\footnote{Appendix~A of \cite{Essick:2016tkn} gives the change to the gravitational-wave phase $\phi(f)$ as a function of frequency and not the change to the Fourier phase $\Psi(f)$ (see e.g. \cite{Lindblom:2008cm} for a discussion of how these differ). The former quantity is useful to compute the change in the number of gravitational-wave cycles, but the latter is required to compute the modification to the TaylorF2 waveform. The study by~\cite{abbott2019constraining} corrects this mistake.} This waveform model can have a degeneracy in the gravitational wave phasing with chirp mass when $n = 4/3$. For this value of $n$, the Fourier phase in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:fourier_phase_final_app}) for nonlinear tides is $\Psi(f) \propto f^{-5/3}$, which is the same power law dependence as the chirp mass phasing. A degeneracy occurs when $f_0$ is comparable or lower than the frequency at which chirp mass can be accurately measured. In this case, the $p$-$g$ mode instability is degenerate with changing the chirp mass. In principle, there will be other degeneracies with other intrinsic parameters of the gravitational wave signal for other values of $n$.

We generate the standard TaylorF2 waveform using the LIGO Algorithm Library~\citep{lal} and multiply this frequency-domain waveform by the term due to the nonlinear tides,
\begin{equation}
\tilde{h}_\mathrm{TaylorF2+NL}(f) = \tilde{h}_\mathrm{TaylorF2}(f) \times \exp[-i \Psi_\mathrm{NL}(f) ].
\end{equation}
The Fourier phase for the nonlinear tides is implemented as a patch to the version of the PyCBC software~\citep{alex_nitz_2018_1208115} used by~\cite{de2018tidal}. Both the standard and nonlinear tide waveform models are terminated when the gravitational-wave frequency reaches that of a test particle at the innermost stable circular orbit of a Schwarszchild black hole of mass $M = m_1 + m_2$. For the neutron star masses considered here, this frequency is between 1.4 kHz and 1.6 kHz.

We also derive the first-order energy dissipation from $p$-$g$ modes in the frequency-domain. This can be solved as, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:e_nl_of_f}
    E_{\mathrm{NL}, i}\left(f'\right) = \int_0^{f'} \left(\frac{dE_{\mathrm{NL}, i}}{dt} \right) \left(\frac{dt}{df}\right) \, df.
\end{equation}
In this derivation we only keep the leading order in $A$, so we take $\frac{dt}{df}$ from the point-particle term in the approximation and neglect terms in $A^2$. The derivation in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:f_dot}) made use of the simplification that $m_1 = m_2$, but we do not take this approach here. The point-particle form of $\frac{dt}{df}$ is~\citep{maggiore2008gravitational}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:point_part_dtdf}
    \frac{dt}{df} = \frac{5}{96} \frac{c^5}{G^{5/3}  \pi^{8/3} \mathcal{M}^{5/3} f^{11/3}}.
\end{equation}
Placing this equation into Eq.~(\ref{eqn:e_nl_decay}) and then placing Eq.~(\ref{eqn:point_part_dtdf}) into Eq.~(\ref{eqn:e_nl_of_f}) gives:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:de_df}
    \frac{dE_{\mathrm{NL}, i}}{df} = \frac{5}{96} \frac{\left(2 m_i\right)^{2/3} \, m_1 \, m_2 \, A \, c^5}{G (m_1 + m_2)\, \pi \, \mathcal{M}^{5/3}} f_{\mathrm{ref}}^{-n-1/3} f^{(n-5/3)} \Theta(f-f_0)
\end{equation}
Integrating this Eq.~(\ref{eqn:de_df}) over all frequencies gives us the energy dissipated by the $p$-$g$ mode instability for a neutron star of mass $m_i$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:E_of_f}
    E_{\mathrm{NL}, i}(f) = \frac{5}{96} \frac{\left(2 m_i\right)^{2/3} \, m_1 \, m_2 \, A \, c^5}{G \, \pi \, (m_1 + m_2) \mathcal{M}^{5/3}} f_{\mathrm{ref}}^{-n-1/3} \left(f^{n-2/3} -f_0^{n-2/3}\right) \frac{1}{n-2/3}.
\end{equation}
Dimensional analysis confirms that Eq.~(\ref{eqn:E_of_f}) is in the form of Joules. In our case however, we are only concerned with the energy dissipated by the $p$-$g$ mode instability at $f_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$ when the stars have finally merged. For neutron stars $f_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$ is always greater than $f_0$, and so the energy dissipation, summing over the contributions from both stars, is:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:E_of_fisco}
    E_{\mathrm{NL}}(f_{\mathrm{ISCO}}) =  \frac{5}{96} \frac{\left(2 m_1 + 2 m_2 \right)^{2/3} \, m_1 \, m_2 \, A \, c^5}{G \, \pi \, \mathcal{M}^{5/3}} f_{\mathrm{ref}}^{-n-1/3} \left(f_{\mathrm{ISCO}}^{n-2/3} -f_0^{n-2/3}\right) \frac{1}{n-2/3}.
\end{equation}

In the next section we move on to describing appropriate prior distribution for the $p$-$g$ mode instability parameters as well as the other intrinsic parameters for GW170817.

\section{Bayesian Model Priors} \label{sec:priors}
Bayes' theorem offers a methodology for evaluating the plausibility of models relative to a given data set, and then updating these prior model beliefs with better hypotheses. Bayes' theorem states, in the notation of Chapter $5$, that
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}\left(\vec{\theta}\,| H, \mathbf{d}\right) = \frac{\pi\left(\vec{\theta}\,|H\right) \, \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{d}|H, \vec{\theta}\,\right)}{\mathcal{Z}\left(\mathbf{d}|H\right)},
\label{eq:bayestheorem}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{Z} \left(\mathbf{d}|H \right)$ is the evidence of the model $H$, $\pi \left(\vec{\theta}\,|H\right)$ is the is the prior distribution of the parameters given the signal model, $\mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{d}|H, \vec{\theta}\right)$ is the likelihood of the data for a particular set of parameters $\vec{\theta}$, and $\mathcal{P}\left( \vec{\theta}\,|H, \mathbf{d}\right)$ is the posterior distribution of the parameters given the signal model. The likelihood used in this analysis assumes a Gaussian model of detector noise and depends upon the noise-weighted inner product between the gravitational waveform and the data from the gravitational-wave detectors~\citep{Finn:2000hj,Rover:2006bb}. The choice of prior distributions on the parameters of the signal model represent the hypothesis that we want to test. The posterior distributions reflect how to update ones beliefs with respect to the likelihood and the data. Thus, by examining many different parameter hypotheses we can investigate the extent to which GW170817 is accurately modeled by $p$-$g$ mode instability waveform models.

In our analysis, we fix the sky location and distance to GW170817~\citep{Soares-Santos:2017lru,Cantiello:2018ffy} and assume that both neutron stars have the same equation of state by imposing the common radius constraint~\citep{de2018tidal}. In the case of the standard TaylorF2 waveform $H_\mathrm{TaylorF2}$, our analysis is identical to that described in~\cite{de2018tidal}. This analysis considered three prior distributions on the binary's component mass. Here, we only consider the uniform prior on each star's mass, with $m_{1,2} \sim U[1,2]\, M_\odot$, and the Gaussian prior on the component masses $m_{1,2} \sim N(\mu = 1.33, \sigma = 0.09)\, M_\odot$~\citep{Ozel:2016oaf}. For both mass priors, we restrict the chirp mass to the range $ 1.1876 M_\odot < \mathcal{M} < 1.2076 M_\odot$. Since our analysis is identical to that of~\citep{de2018tidal}, we refer to that paper for the details of the data analysis configuration.

Given the uncertainty on the range of the nonlinear tide parameters, we follow~\cite{abbott2019constraining} and let $n \in U[-1.1, 2.999]$, draw $A$ from a distribution uniform in $\log_{10}$ between $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-5.5}$, and $f_0 \in U[10, 100]$~Hz. We use this along with a uniform prior distribution on the mass from~\cite{de2018tidal}.

We also consider two alternative choices of drawing $f_0$: we draw $f_0$ from a uniform distribution between $15$ and $100$~Hz, as used by~\cite{Essick:2016tkn}, and from a uniform distribution between $15$ and $800$~Hz to allow for the larger values of $f_0$ suggested by~\cite{Zhou:2018tvc} and~\cite{Andersson:2017iav}. For these choices we consider $A$ uniform in $\log_{10}$ between $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-6}$. For these alternative prior distributions we also consider applying a further constraint on the parameters. Since some combinations of $A$, $n$, and $f_0$ can produce extremely small gravitational-wave phase shifts~\citep{Essick:2016tkn}, we place a cut on the gravitational-wave phase shift due to nonlinear tides
\begin{equation}
\delta \phi(f_\mathrm{ISCO}) =
                      \frac{-25}{768}  \frac{A}{n-3} \left( \frac{G \mathcal{M} \pi f_{\mathrm{ref}}}{c^3} \right)^{-10/3} \left[ \left( \frac{f_0}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right)^{n-3} - \left(\frac{f_\mathrm{ISCO}}{f_{\mathrm{ref}}} \right)^{n-3} \right],
\end{equation}
where $f_\mathrm{ISCO}$ is the termination frequency of the waveform (which is always larger than $f_0$ in our analysis). This gravitational-wave phase shift from the $p$-$g$ mode instability is strictly negative, but we take the convention of using the absolute value of the phase shift for convenience. We restrict the prior space to values of $\delta \phi > 0.1$~rad. Phase shifts of $\delta \phi \approx 0.1$~rad have an overlap between the two waveform models greater than 99.98\%. This cut means that the resulting priors on $A$, $n$, and $f_0$ are not uniform, but are biased in favor of combinations of parameters that may produce a measurable effect on the phasing of the waveform due to nonlinear tides. While $\delta \phi$ is a simple proxy for how similar or dissimilar two waveforms are, formally this is given by the match between two waveforms. A $\delta \phi$ of $1$ radian may have a low overlap with a waveform if the radian is accumulated over a large bandwidth but a high overlap if the radian is accumulated near the very end of the signal. Fig.~\ref{fig:priors} shows a depiction of the prior distributions used when using a permissive prior on $\delta \phi$, similar to~\cite{abbott2019constraining}, and when using a constraint on the $p$-$g$ mode parameters such that $\delta \phi > 0.1$~rad.

A stricter approach to constructing a prior distribution that considers $p$-$g$ mode effects that are distinguishable from standard waveforms is to examine the fitting factor between a distribution of $p$-$g$ mode waveforms and a set of comparable TaylorF2 waveforms. To do so, we examine the fitting factor of our Bayesian inference analysis with respect to a template bank of non-spinning, mass-only TaylorF2 waveforms. We construct a template bank of $\sim 20,000$ non-spinning, mass-only waveforms of comparable masses to the prior distribution on the mass parameters. The template bank is constructed with component masses, $m_{(1,2)} \in (1.0, 2.0) M_{\odot}$, chirp masses, $\mathcal{M}_c \in (1.1826, 1.2126) M_{\odot}$, and a minimal match placement of 99.9\%. We then place a threshold on the evidence calculation from the Bayesian analysis based on the maximum overlap with this template bank of standard waveforms. This permits an analysis of the Bayes factor for nonlinear tides where the prior distribution on $p$-$g$ mode parameters is determined by the fitting factor with a set of standard signals.

\section{Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing Methods} \label{sec:methods}
We use the gravitational-wave strain data from the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors for the GW170817 event, made available through the GW Open Science Center~\citep{Vallisneri:2014vxa,gw170817-losc}. We then repeat the analysis of~\cite{de2018tidal} using the waveform model $H_\mathrm{TaylorF2+NL}$ to compute the evidence $p(\mathbf{d}\, | \, \mathrm{H}_\mathrm{TaylorF2+NL})$.

We use Bayesian model selection to determine which of the two waveform models described in Sec.~\ref{sec:waveform} is better supported by the observation of GW170817. Bayes' theorem in Eq.~(\ref{eq:bayestheorem}) permits us a method for model comparison through the ratio of the evidence from each model. This ratio of the model evidences is called the Bayes factor, which we denote as $\mathcal{B}$. A Bayes factor greater than unity indicates support for the model in the numerator, while a Bayes factor less than unity indicates support for the model in the denominator. The Bayes factor can be written as,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}^{\mathrm{NL}}_{\mathrm{!NL}} \ = \frac{\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d} \, | \, H_\mathrm{NL})}{\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d} \, | \, H_\mathrm{!NL})}.
\end{equation}\label{eq:bayesfactor}
The numerator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:bayesfactor}) is the evidence for nonlinear tides $\mathcal{Z} (\mathbf{d} \, | \, \mathrm{NL})$. For the denominator of Eq.~(\ref{eq:bayesfactor}), we use the evidence $\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d} \, | \, \mathrm{!NL})$ provided as supplemental materials by~\citep{de2018tidal}. We have used $\mathrm{NL}$ ($\mathrm{!NL}$) to denote the nonlinear tidal (standard models).

Posterior distributions for parameters of interest can be also computed by marginalizing the posterior probability distribution over other parameters.  Marginalization to obtain the posterior probabilities and the evidence is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To compute posterior probability distributions and evidences, we use the \emph{PyCBC Inference} software~\citep{alex_nitz_2018_1208115,biwer2019pycbc} using the parallel-tempered \emph{emcee} sampler~\citep{emcee,vousden:2016}.
This sampler allows the use of multiple temperatures to sample the parameter space~\citep{emcee, doi:10.1143/PTPS.157.317, B509983H}. These multiple temperatures $\beta$ permit the construction of tempered posterior distributions that form a slow thermodynamic transition from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution in Eq.~\ref{eq:bayestheorem}. Tempered posteriors are called power-posteriors in~\cite{lartillot2006computing, friel2008marginal}. The power-posterior can be according to:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(\vec{\theta} \, | \,\mathbf{d}, H)_\beta \propto \pi(\vec{\theta} \, | \, H) \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d} \, | \, \vec{\theta}, H)^\beta.
\end{equation}\label{eq:power_posterior}
The normalization constant for a power-posterior is the evidence for that power-posterior, given as $\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d} \, | \, H)_\beta = \int \pi\left(\vec{\theta} \, | \, H\right) \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d} \, | \, \vec{\theta}, H)^\beta d\vec{\theta}$.

From these power-posterior distributions we use the thermodynamic integration method~\citep{lartillot2006computing,friel2008marginal} to estimate the logarithm of the evidence, ln $\mathcal{Z}$, given as:
\begin{equation}
\textrm{ln} \, \mathcal{Z} = \int_0^1 \langle \textrm{ln} \, \mathcal{L} \rangle_{\beta} \, d\beta.
\label{eqn:thermodyn_int}
\end{equation}
The estimate of the evidence is determined by the integral over inverse temperatures, $\beta$, of the average untempered log likelihood, $\langle \textrm{ln}\, \mathcal{L} \rangle_{\beta}$, drawn from the power-posterior corresponding to the inverse temperature $\beta$. An approximation to this integral can be made through use of trapezoid rule integration method. Following~\cite{de2018tidal} we use $51$ temperatures where we use a combination of geometric and logarithmic temperature placements to improve the accuracy of the integral~\citep{liu2016evaluating}.

We verify the results of the thermodynamic integration evidence calculation by comparing it with the steppingstone algorithm~\citep{xie2010improving}, which utilizes the same likelihoods from multi-tempering sampling as the thermodynamic integration method. Both trapezoidal rule thermodynamic integration and steppingstone methods can have some bias in the estimate of the logarithm of the Bayesian evidence due to a finite number of temperatures being used. This bias is mitigated by an increased number of temperatures~\citep{xie2010improving, Russel:2018pqv}. Additionally, this bias can be mitigated in thermodynamic integration by improving the order of the quadrature integration~\citep{friel2014improving}. We also use a higher order trapezoidal rule from~\cite{friel2014improving} and verify that the results are consistent.

We also estimate the error for each method of evidence calculation. The thermodynamic integration method and steppingstone algorithm both contain Monte Carlo error~\citep{annis2019thermodynamic}. For the thermodynamic integration method the Monte Carlo error on the thermodynamic integral can be estimated following the methodology of~\cite{annis2019thermodynamic}. We use this same uncertainty estimate for the higher order trapezoidal rule as well. In~\cite{xie2010improving} there is a Monte Carlo variance estimate for the logarithm of the evidence from the steppingstone method that we also use here.

The last source of error in the evidence calculation that we consider is whether the MCMC has converged to stable likelihood values across all of the temperatures. This requires examining the stability of the evidence calculations as the MCMC progresses. Independent samples are drawn according to the $\mathrm{n_{acl}}$ method as described by~\cite{biwer2019pycbc} at various points in the run. This method takes a specific endpoint iteration, takes half the endpoint iteration as the starting point iteration, and calculates the autocorrelation length of the samples between the starting point and the endpoint iteration. Independent samples are drawn in intervals of the maximum autocorrelation length for the samples within this segment. We divide the full run into $12$ segments and calculate the evidence from each one of these segments to examine how the evidence progresses along the MCMC iterations. Gradually the evidence begins to settle towards a constant value as the MCMC progresses. We take the difference between the last two evidence estimates as the convergence error.

We estimate the total error on our evidence calculations, $\sigma_{\mathrm{ln} \, \mathcal{Z}}$, by adding the errors in quadrature according to,
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathrm{ln} \, \mathcal{Z}} = \sqrt{ \sigma_{\mathrm{MC}}^2 + \sigma_{\mathrm{convergence}}^2 } \, .
\label{eq:errorprop}
\end{equation}
Here, the error $\sigma_{MC}$ is the Monte Carlo error and $\sigma_{\mathrm{convergence}}$ is the convergence error. Finally, to estimate the Bayes factors we model the log evidence as a normal distribution, with mean given from the log evidence calculation, and standard deviation given by the error propagation formula in Eq.~(\ref{eq:errorprop}). The logarithm of the Bayes factor can then be calculated from the difference in the logarithm of the evidences. The standard Bayes factor is then the exponential of the logarithm of the Bayes factor.

As a means of verifying the results from the above Bayes factor calculations we also make use of the Savage-Dickey density ratio method~\citep{edwards1963bayesian, dickey1971weighted, wagenmakers2010bayesian} for calculating the Bayes factor of the model where the $p$-$g$ mode parameters were chosen independently of one another. This is the approach taken in~\cite{abbott2019constraining}.

For certain kinds nested models where prior distributions on parameters are \textit{factorizable}, or independent from one another, there exists a method for deriving the Bayes factor for two models from one parameter estimation Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis. If there exists a parameter $A$ for which at a critical value $A_\mathrm{crit}$ the parameter model is equivalent to a nested model that has no parameterization in $A$, then the Bayes factor for the model with $A$ compared to the model without $A$ is taken as the limit of the prior density at $A_\mathrm{crit}$ relative to the posterior density at $A_\mathrm{crit}$ when sampled from the model that includes $A$. This method does not require a multi-dimensional integral or one-dimensional integral to be approximated. In the case of the $p$-$g$ mode instability the parameter that effectively turns on and turns off the instability is the amplitude factor $A$. The Bayes factor form the Savage-Dickey density ratio is the ratio of the probability densities between the prior distribution density as $A \to 0$ and the posterior distribution density as $A \to 0$. This expression can be written as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sddr_bayes_factor}
    \mathcal{B}^{\mathrm{NL}}_{\mathrm{!NL}} = \lim_{\mathrm{A} \to 0} \, \frac{\pi\left(\mathrm{A} \, | \,  H^{NL}\right)}{\mathcal{P}\left(\mathrm{A} \, | \, \mathbf{d}, H^{NL}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Formally, the parameter model is constructed such that the prior density on $A$ is distributed uniformly in $\mathrm{log}_{10} \, A$ and so the limit cannot be strictly taken from within the data acquired in these analyses. However, when $A is 10^{-10}$, the matched-filter is not sensitive enough to to distinguish the difference between $A=0$ and $A=10^{-10}$ to $> 99.99\%$ overlap. This indicates that substituting $A \to 0$ for $A \to 10^{-10}$ will generate indistinguishable results in this analysis.

This changes the problem of inference from numerical integration to that of probability density estimation. In our analysis, only the unconstrained $\delta \phi$ model has a marginal prior distribution on $A$ that is independent of all of the other parameter priors. This model is similar to~\cite{abbott2019constraining}, where $A$ is uniform in $\log_{10}$ between $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-5.5}$. Our prior distributional density is analytic and we know the exact prior probability density at $10^{-10}$ is $0.2\overbar{2222}$. This reduces the probability density inference to the marginal posterior distribution density on $A$ at $10^{-10}$. There are a variety of methods for estimating the density of a probability distributions from samples of data that we introduced in Chapter 5. We consider the histogram method using Scott's binning method~\cite{scott1979optimal}, the histogram method using the Freedman-Diaconis binning method~\cite{Freedman1981}, the Gaussian kernel density estimator GetDist from~\cite{lewis2015getdist}, and the logspline estimator from~\citep{stone1997polynomial}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Compared to the standard waveform model, we find that the $p$-$g$ mode model with priors where $\delta \phi$ is unconstrained gives a Bayes factor of order unity. When we use $p$-$g$ mode priors where $\delta \phi$ $>$ $0.1$~radians we also find a Bayes factor of order unity. Following the Bayes factor interpretation of \cite{kass1995bayes, jeffreys1998theory}, these Bayes factors cannot be considered to be statistically significant. A Bayes factor of unity indicates that whatever prior beliefs we had about the plausibility of the $p$-$g$ mode instability prior to the observation of GW170817 is unchanged by the observation of GW170817. For the narrow range of $15 \le f_0 \le 100$~Hz where $\delta \phi > 0.1$~rad, we find that the Bayes factor is $\sim 0.7$. This is also true of the prior range $10 \le f_0 \le 100$~Hz with unconstrained $\delta \phi$. The broader range  $15 \le f_0 \le 800$~Hz, where $\delta \phi > 0.1$~rad, we find that $\mathcal{B} \sim 0.7$ as well. Our estimated statistical error on Bayes factors due to Monte Carlo uncertainty and convergence uncertainty is $\sim \pm 0.1$ at the $90$\% confidence level. In Section~\ref{sec:ti_ssa_performance} we discuss the performance of the Bayes factor estimation from the multi-tempered Bayesian evidence estimators. In Section~\ref{sec:prob_density_estimator_performance} we verify the results of the multi-tempered Bayes factor estimates with the Savage-Dickey density ratio test for the unconstrained $\delta \phi$ model. 

\subsection{Multi-Tempered Bayes Factors}\label{sec:ti_ssa_performance}
Our Bayes factor estimation from $6$ multi-tempered estimators on the logarithm of the Bayes factor can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:lvc_sim_uni_ceos_bayes_distr} when comparing the hypothesis on $p$-$g$ mode instability for the unconstrained $\delta \phi$ prior to the hypothesis presented in~\cite{de2018tidal} for the uniform mass prior with a common equation of state constraint. The $6$ multi-tempered estimators are fully described in Chapter 5; they are the thermodynamic integration method with the trapezoidal rule, a first-order correction to the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, a first-order correction to Simpson's rule, a cubic integration rule, and the steppingstone method. The different methods give similar probability distributions on the estimate of the Bayes factor. Those Bayes factor uncertainty distributions follow a log-normal distribution and have tails that skew towards a Bayes factor of unity.

The Bayes factors for all hypotheses using all of the quadrature methods in Chapter $5$ can be seen in Table~\ref{table:Bayes}. The median values of the Bayes factors range between roughly $0.63$ and $0.76$, with the $5$th and $95$th percentile interval being $\sim \pm 0.1$. Under a binary choice between the $p$-$g$ mode instability model and the standard model we can calculate a posterior probability of the nonlinear tidal hypothesis. Without giving preference to either model, we calculate a posterior probability of $\mathcal{P}(\mathrm{H}_{NL} \, | \, \mathbf{d})$ between $34$ \%  and $46 \%$ at the $5 \%$ and $95 \%$ confidence levels. These posterior probabilities correspond to an odds of $0.5 \, : \, 1$ and $0.85 \, : \, 1$, which are not statistically significant and indicate that the data are uninformative to testing either hypothesis. If we consider all models collectively, the posterior probability on any one particular model reduces significantly due to the increase in number of hypotheses available to consider.

\subsection{Savage-Dickey Density Ratio Bayes Factors}\label{sec:prob_density_estimator_performance}
We report on the Bayes factors from the Savage-Dickey density ratio test on the model for $p$-$g$ mode instability for an unconstrained $\delta \phi$ prior compared to a standard model. The Savage-Dickey density ratio requires us to know the probability density for the marginal prior and posterior on $A$ at $10^{-10}$.

Since the marginal prior and posterior distribution functions on $A$ are distributed logarithmically, it is convenient to do the density estimation in the $\mathrm{log}_{10} \, A$. Under this change of variables the marginal prior distribution on $\mathrm{log}_{10} \, A$ is uniform between $-10$ and $-5.5$, hence the prior distribution function is:
\begin{equation}
    \pi\left(\mathrm{log}_{10} \, A\right) = \frac{1}{-5.5 - (-10)} = 0.2\overbar{2}, \qquad -10.0 \leq \mathrm{log}_{10} \, A \leq -5.5
\end{equation}

Following this we estimate the marginal posterior probability density of $\mathrm{log}_{10} \, A$ using the Savage-Dickey density ratio methods in Chapter $5$. We use the two histogram density estimator methods with Scott's binning rule and the Freedman-Diaconis binning rule for the posterior probability density estimation. We also use the Gaussian kernel density estimator GetDist, and the logspline density estimating package found in R for this posterior probability density estimation. A comparison of the density estimates for the marginal posterior probability density on $\mathrm{log}_{10} \, A$ for the different density estimators can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:density_estimators}. We then calculate the Savage-Dickey density ratio Bayes factor and use a bootstrap resampling method to resample the posterior distribution $5,000$ times to get a confidence interval on our Bayes factor estimates. The results can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sddr_bayes_factor_comparisons}, and are summarized in Table~\ref{Bayes_sddr}.

\subsection{Parameter Estimation Results}
Bayes factor hypothesis testing only provides half of the Bayesian inference method~\cite{read2006encyclopedia}. In this section we examine the results of the parameter estimation if we assume that nonlinear tides are present in the GW170817 signal. Remarkably, when we consider the way that the nonlinear tides enter the Fourier phase in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:fourier_phase_eq1}), we see that if $n = 4/3$ then the nonlinear tides enter the Fourier phase of the waveform with the same power law dependence on frequency $f$ as the chirp mass, that is $\Psi(f) \propto f^{-5/3}$. We also note that for the effect of nonlinear tides to be degenerate with chirp mass, they must turn on at a frequency $f_0$ that is close to the low-frequency limit of the detector's sensitive band. If the effect turns on at higher frequencies, then the phasing will change in the detector's sensitive band and it is more difficult to compensate for the nonlinear tide effect with a change in chirp mass. 

The marginalized posterior distributions on parameters shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:uniform_f0_small} show a strong degeneracy between the source-frame chirp mass $\mathcal{M}^\textrm{src}$ and nonlinear tides that creates a tail in the chirp mass posterior skewed towards lower values of chirp mass than the value measured using the standard waveform model, $\mathcal{M}^\textrm{src} = 1.1867\pm0.0001\, M_\odot$~\citep{de2018tidal}. We see a peak in the posteriors of $n$ and $f_0$ at $n \lesssim 4/3$ and $f_0 \lesssim 35$~Hz. This parameter degeneracy is also correlated with large $A$, where $10^{-8} \lesssim A < 10^{-6}$. The samples with large posterior values of $\delta\phi$ seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:uniform_f0_small} are strongly correlated with source-frame chirp masses $\mathcal{M}^\textrm{src} \lesssim 1.1866.$ We have examined the change to the posterior distribution when changing the low-frequency cutoff of the likelihood integration from $20$~Hz to $25$~Hz, and to $30$~Hz. In these analyses, the peak in the posterior of $f_0$ tracks the low-frequency cutoff of the likelihood integration, confirming that this effect is due to the chirp-mass degeneracy with the low-frequency cutoff. The chirp mass degeneracy is also present in the analysis with the broader range of $f_0$, however it is not as pronounced in the posterior samples due to the larger prior space being explored.

We also examine the leading order estimated energy dissipated through nonlinear tides for the case of a uniform prior on the mass, with $15 \leq f_0 \leq 100$~Hz, with a $\delta \phi$ $>$ $0.1$ radian constraint. In our analysis, the $95$th percentile of the estimated energy dissipated through nonlinear tides from our prior distribution is approximately $2.6 \times 10^{51}$~ergs at the terminating frequency of the TaylorF2 waveform, $f_\mathrm{ISCO}$. The estimated energy radiated by gravitational waves by neutron stars of the estimated mass range of GW170817 is greater than $\sim 10^{53}$~ergs. Our analysis finds the energy dissipated through nonlinear tides at the $95\%$ posterior credible percentile is $3 \times 10^{50}$~ergs. We find our $95\%$ posterior credible percentile to be less than the $90\%$ confidence interval constraint of $\lesssim 2.7 \times 10^{51}$~ergs in~\cite{abbott2019constraining}. Samples from our posterior distribution that have dissipation energies greater than the $90$\% credible interval tend to come from two modes in the parameter space. The first mode is from parts of the parameter space with large $A$, for $n \sim 4/3$, low $f_0$, and $\delta \phi \sim 100$~rad. The second mode is from parts of the parameter space with $A \gtrsim 10^{-8}$, for $1.6 \lesssim n < 3.0$, and $\delta \phi \sim 1-10$~rad. The high end of the nonlinear tidal energy constraints are thus dominated by waveforms that are degenerate with the standard signal.

\subsection{Improving the Chirp Mass Degeneracy with an Independent Electromagnetic Observation}
In this section we consider whether the chirp mass degeneracy could be mitigated by the measurement of the chirp mass by an independent electromagnetic observation. We find that we require a very strong constraint on the chirp mass independent of the gravitational wave data to mitigate the parameter degeneracy from the $p$-$g$ mode instability. Here we make a quantitative analysis of how accurate an electromagnetic observer's measurement of the chirp mass would have to be to constrain the chirp mass back to the measurements found in~\cite{de2018tidal}.

To do so we consider the joint posterior distribution, $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, | \,  \mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}})$, from two statistically independent data sets, the gravitational wave data $\mathbf{d_{GW}}$, and a mock electromagnetic data set $\mathbf{d_{EM}}$. We then define a (hyper) prior on the chirp mass that we believe credible from the joint observation of GW170817 from gravitational wave detectors and a mock electromagnetic observer. The joint posterior distribution on the chirp mass is then
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, | \,  \mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}}) = \frac{\pi(\mathcal{M})}{\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}})}  \,  \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}} \, | \, \mathcal{M}).
\end{equation}
We can separate  $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}} \, | \, \mathcal{M})$ into  $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{GW}} \, | \, \mathcal{M}) \, \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{EM}} \, | \, \mathcal{M})$ since the measurements are statistically independent measurements of the chirp mass of the binaries. This gives 
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, | \,  \mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}}) = \frac{\pi(\mathcal{M})}{\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}})} \, \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{GW}} \, | \, \mathcal{M}) \, \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{EM}} \, | \, \mathcal{M}).
\end{equation}
Here $\mathcal{Z}(\mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}})$ is the normalizing constant that maintains the equality. Since we only consider one parameter $\mathcal{M}$ we can calculate this normalizing constant using a fine-grid trapezoidal rule. We denote this normalizing constant as $c$ from now on. To find the marginal likelihood of $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{GW}} \, | \, \mathcal{M})$ we use Bayes' theorem from the available marginal posterior distribution on $\mathcal{M}$. That is, we use $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{d_{GW}} \, | \, \mathcal{M}) = \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, | \, \mathbf{d_{GW}}) / \pi_{\mathrm{GW}} (\mathcal{M})$ for the properly normalized marginal posterior and prior distributions on the chirp mass. We can now express the joint posterior distribution as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, |  \, \mathbf{d_{GW}}, \mathbf{d_{EM}}) = \frac{\pi(\mathcal{M})}{c} \times \frac{\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, | \, \mathbf{d_{GW}})}{\pi_{\mathrm{GW}}(\mathcal{M})} \times \frac{\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} \, | \, \mathbf{d_{EM}})}{\pi_{\mathrm{EM}}(\mathcal{M})}
\end{equation}

Now, since our electromagnetic observer is purely hypothetical we let $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M} | \mathbf{d_{EM}})$ be a Gaussian distribution whose mean value estimation of the chirp mass is centered at the posterior mode of the standard models marginal chirp mass posterior distribution~\cite{de2018tidal}. We will vary the standard deviation of this Gaussian distribution to see when the mock electromagnetic observer constrains the joint observation to be nearly identical to the measurement of the chirp mass from the standard model of~\cite{2018tidal}. We specify our (hyper) prior $\pi(\mathcal{M}) = \pi_{\mathrm{GW}}(\mathcal{M}) = \pi_{\mathrm{EM}}(\mathcal{M})$. The prior of $\pi_{\mathrm{GW}}(\mathcal{M})$ was uniform in chirp mass in the detector fram between $\mathcal{M} \in (1.1876, 1.2076)$. The mock estimation procedure can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:em_posterior_analysis} where we find that an electromagnetic observer would need a constraint on $\sigma_{\mathcal{M}} < 0.0001 M_{\odot}$. This corresponds to a measurement error on the chirp mass of less than $0.017~\%$, well outside the realm of current methods.

One might consider an improvement on this approach by using the marginal chirp mass distribution when marginalizing over all $p$-$g$ mode models and then comparing it to the marginal chirp mass distribution when marginalizing over all models in~\cite{de2018tidal}. The result, however, is qualitatively identical.

\subsection{Strict Constraints on the $p$-$g$ mode instability}
Given the observed parameter degeneracies and the statistically nonsignificant results of the nonlinear tidal hypotheses that we have tested, we now investigate whether there are regions of the parameter space where nonlinear tidal effects are not degenerate with standard waveforms. We do this by thresholding the results of our Bayesian MCMC analysis $p$-$g$ waveforms on their fitting factor with standard waveforms. We combine the results of our analysis on the uniform mass, $\delta \phi \, > \, 0.1$~rads, narrow $f_0$ prior distribution model to obtain $22,600$ independent samples. We then examine the fitting factor of every independent sample, from every temperature, with a non-spinning, mass-only template bank of TaylorF2 waveforms with comparable masses to GW170817. For simplicity, we only keep the mass parameters and $p$-$g$ mode parameters in the overlap calculations, since the correlation between nonlinear tidal dynamics is most apparent in the measured chirp mass. When we examine the fitting factor between nonlinear tidal waveforms and this template bank we observe that there is a very high match between standard templates and nonlinear tidal waveforms when $n = 4/3$. The nonlinear tidal waveforms that least match this template bank tend to be those parameterized by large amplitude and large gravitational-wave phase shift. We then recompute the Bayes factor when discarding samples from the analysis below a particular fitting factor with the template bank. To ensure a robustness of the point-estimate we use a bootstrap method to estimate the Monte Carlo error for this Bayes factor estimate~\citep{efron1992bootstrap}. The bootstrap estimated Monte Carlo error tends to be much larger than the convergence error for this analysis and so we neglect inclusion of convergence error in the estimate. A statistically significant Bayes factor of $\sim 30 \, (20)$, against nonlinear tides, is found when the waveform has an overlap less than $98.5 \, (98.85)$\% match with the standard waveform, see Fig.~\ref{fig:bayes_ff_plot}. While this metric is insufficient to rule out the $p$-$g$ mode instability, it is a useful metric in understanding why the evidence is nearly identical to the evidence from~\cite{de2018tidal}. We find that portions of the $p$-$g$ mode parameter space that most contribute towards the evidence come from regions of the parameter space that have a high overlap with standard waveforms. This occurs either through $A$ being too small to induce a large change in the phase of the waveform or through an associated parameter degeneracy with the chirp mass caused by large $A$, low $f_0$, and $n \sim 4/3$.

\section{Discussion}
We have used the observation of GW170817 and the model of~\cite{Essick:2016tkn} to look for evidence of nonlinear tides from $p$-$g$ mode coupling during the inspiral~\citep{Weinberg:2013pbi,Weinberg:2015pxa,Zhou:2018tvc}. Over the broad prior space, we find a Bayes factor of unity which gives an inconclusive result on whether nonlinear tides are favored or disfavored in GW170817, consistent with \cite{abbott2019constraining}. This Bayes factor can be interpreted as stating that there is insufficient evidence to change our prior beliefs about the credibility of the $p$-$g$ mode hypothesis after the observation of GW170817. A closer examination of the posterior distribution lead us to conclude that nonlinear tides are consistent with the signal GW170817 because they either cause very small phase shifts to the waveform, or the nonlinear tides must enter the waveform in a way that is degenerate with the other intrinsic parameters of GW170817. Regions of the nonlinear tide parameter space that have a fitting factor of less than 99\% (98.5\%) are  disfavored by a Bayes factor of 15 (25). we find that waveforms from a $p$-$g$ mode instability with overlap $>98.5$ \%, tend to either induce a very small phase shifts to the waveform or are degenerate with other intrinsic parameters of GW170817. This leads us to conclude that modeling GW170817 with nonlinear tidal parameters may not offer advantages over using a simpler model. We conclude that the consistency of the GW170817 signal with the model of \cite{Essick:2016tkn} is due to parameter degeneracy and that regions where nonlinear tides produce a measurable effect are strongly disfavored.

In principle, one could improve our analysis by separately parameterizing the amplitude, turn-on frequency, and frequency evolution for each star as in~\cite{abbott2019constraining}. However, we find our results to be broadly consistent with~\cite{abbott2019constraining}, and so we do not expect these to affect the main conclusion of our paper. Further improvements on the  parametric model of $p$-$g$ mode instability could include a higher order post-Newtonian expansion of the instability, or further understanding of the instability's interaction with neutron star magnetic fields~\citep{Weinberg:2015pxa}. Nonlinear tides are poorly understood and the contribution from other stellar oscillation modes may yet contribute to a more accurate picture of the interior dynamics of neutron stars~\citep{Andersson:2017iav}. Current models of the gravitational-wave phase shift caused by nonlinear tides from the $p$-$g$ mode instability  suffer from parameter degeneracies with the other intrinsic parameters of a neutron star binary. A measurement of the binary's chirp mass that is independent of gravitational-wave observations would break this degeneracy. However, for a system like GW170817, this would require measurement of the binary's chirp mass to a precision greater than $\sim 0.02 \%$ using an electromagnetic counterpart, which is implausible. Absent improved theoretical understanding of  nonlinear tides from $p$-$g$ mode coupling that can excludes degenerate regions of the parameter space \emph{a priori}, we do not expect this situation to improve with future detections.

Finally, we now it will ever be possible to accumulate sufficient evidence to rule-in, or rule-out the presence of nonlinear tides due to a $p$-$g$ mode instability. When more binary neutron star events are detected by gravitational wave networks it will be possible to take advantage of the fact that we can accumulate evidence for hypotheses across statistically independent events. The Bayes factor for testing the same hypotheses for many events is the product of the Bayes factor for the hypothesis for each individual observation of the merger of binary neutron stars. As more binary neutron star events are detected we can accumulate evidence for or against $p$-$g$ mode instability through continuous testing of these hypotheses on these individual events. We can also update our parameter inference on the nonlinear tidal parameters to potentially constrain them more sharply. In Chapter 5 we described how to use the Bayes factor for $N$ events to build a combined Bayes factor via following expression. There are no publicly available binary neutron stars other than the observation of GW170817 to build evidence for the nonlinear tidal hypothesis so we consider the hypothetical case where multiple GW170817-like neutron star events are detected.

To do so we consider the results of our current analysis on GW170817. Here we consider two estimators for the logarithm Bayes factor, the thermodynamic integration method which we found to have a log Bayes factor of $\mu \sim -0.38$, and at worst $\sigma \sim 0.1$, and the logspline estimator with the Savage Dickey density ratio which we found to have a log Bayes factor of $\mu \sim -0.46, \sigma \sim 0.06$. While the log Bayes factor for the thermodynamic integration method is formally log-normal, the Bayes factor estimated from the logspline estimator is not formally log-normal. This discrepancy does not significantly affect our proposed analysis. We also consider the analysis of~\cite{abbott2019constraining} which found a log Bayes factor of $0.03^{+0.70}_{-0.58}$ at $90 \%$ confidence using the Savage-Dickey density ratio. We model this as a Gaussian distribution in the logarithm Bayes factor with $\mu = 0.03, \sigma = 0.4$ so as to have a similar $90\%$ interval width. The hypothesis test of~\cite{abbott2019constraining} is distinct from our own in that the waveform model parametrizes the nonlinear tidal parameters for each star independently and makes different assumptions about the correlation between the nonlinear tidal parameters and the masses of the binaries. This could be considered a systematic difference in the waveform modeling that could potentially impact Bayesian inference. In Chapter 5 we discussed how a combined Bayes factor for continued testing of a hypothesis over many observations could be attained by multiplying the Bayes factor from each observation. We illustrate this method in Fig.~\ref{fig:sim_many_gw170817_divergent_bayes} where we show the divergence of the Bayes factors after $15$ repeat observations of GW170817 for Bayesian hypothesis test techniques and potentially due to waveform systematics. After $15$ repeat observations of GW170817 our thermodynamic integration and logspline Savage-Dickey density ratio estimates give a statistically significant result where we can confidently reject the nonlinear tidal hypothesis. Our model of the analysis of~\cite{abbott2019constraining} suggests a different decision, i.e. statistical significance is not achieved. The assumptions of this approach are very strong and are not motivated by realistic physics, but they highlight the importance of the need for robust understanding of our systematic and statistical uncertainties when we use Bayesian hypothesis testing. 

A more realistic approach would be to consider the a realistic population of binary neutron star mergers. Considerations for the source properties have been discussed in this chapter of this dissertation as well as in chapter $3$ of this dissertion.
A software injection campaign where simulated binary neutron stars drawn from a model of the population of neutron stars could be considered like in chapter $3$ of this dissertation. Simulated signals could be added to different Gaussian noise realizations informed by the expected sensitivity of future observing runs from Advanced LIGO and Virgo. Bayesian inference and hypotheses could be performed on each simulated signal and predictions about future events could be made. The largest contributor to the Bayesian inference will in all likelihood be due to signals with the largest signal to noise ratio $rho$. For isotropically and homogeneously distributed binary neutron star mergers we can expect a power-law distribution on the $\rho$~\cite{schutz2011networks, chen2014loudest}. More specifically, we can expect that for a network of interferometers with a signal to noise ratio detection threshold of $\rho_{\mathrm{threshold}}$ that our distribution will follow
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:universal_snr}
    p(\rho) = 3 \, \frac{\rho_{\mathrm{threshold}}^3}{\rho^4}.
\end{equation}
This expression is a normalized probability distribution function in the domain that $\rho > \rho_{\mathrm{threshold}}$. The signal to noise ratio $\rho$ is permitted to go to positive infinity. From Eq.~(\ref{eqn:universal_snr}) we can expect an average $\rho$ to be equal to $\frac{3}{2} \rho_{\mathrm{threshold}}$. If we assume a very conservative $\rho_{\mathrm{threshold}} = 11$, then the probability of observing a gravitational wave neutron star mergers with signal to noise ratio greater than or equal to the signal to noise ratio of GW170817 ($\rho \approx 34$) is $\sim 3~\%$. At a signal to noise ratio of $\sim 34$ we have found that the $p$-$g$ mode instability hypothesis has a Bayes factor of approximately $1$. We expect that $97 \%$ of neutron star detections will have a lower signal to noise ratio than GW170817 and so we expect that the Bayes factor will be less informative for the $p$-$g$ mode instability hypothesis than it was for the observation of GW170817. For these $97 \%$ of mergers the parameter degeneracies between the nonlinear tidal parameters and the other intrinsic parameters of the binary may be more pronounced and less informative. Moreover, the study of~\cite{Essick:2016tkn} found that the nonlinear tidal parameters are degenerate with the inferred luminosity distance of the binary. While the waveform model of~\cite{Essick:2016tkn} incorrectly used the stationary phase approximation in the construction of the waveform model, c.f. this study and~\cite{abbott2019constraining}, this degeneracy could potentially obscure future studies of the nonlinear tidal hypothesis with future binary neutron stars. With all of this in mind, i.e. the difficulties in parameter estimation and Bayesian hypothesis testing, we may have to wait for hundreds of binary neutron star mergers to accumulate sufficient evidence to make a decision on whether binary neutron stars are contain nonlinear tides from a $p$-$g$ mode instability. Additional choices on conductin and tuning an MCMC analysis in addition to what choice of prior distributions in the modeling will make this endeavor all the more difficult.

The three-detector network signal to noise ratio for each sample is given on the color-bar. The posterior scatter plots show 50\% and 90\% credible interval contours. The posteriors on $n$ is peaked $n \lesssim 4/3$ and for values of $f_0$ close to the lower end of the detector's low frequency sensitivity. In this region of parameters space, the effect of nonlinear tides is degenerate with chirp mass, causing a secondary peak in the chirp mass posterior. It can be seen from the $\delta\phi$--$\mathcal{M}$ plot (lower left) that large phase shifts due to nonlinear tides are due to points in parameter space where a value of chirp mass can be found that compensates for the phase shift of the nonlinear tides. These are the combined posteriors from $9$ runs. It is notable that the the peaks in the $f_0$ posterior, at $f_0 \approx 30$~Hz and $f_0 \approx 70$~Hz seem to be reversed from those in Fig 2. of \citep{abbott2019constraining}. Note that the marginalized posterior for $A$ is diminished for $A < 10^{-8}$ due to the $\delta \phi$ prior constraint.}

The $\mathcal{B}^{\mathrm{NL}}_{\mathrm{!NL}}$(Scott) column is the Bayes factor estimate under Scott's histogram binning rule. The $\mathcal{B}^{\mathrm{NL}}_{\mathrm{!NL}}$(Gaussian KDE) column is the Bayes factor estimate when using the Gaussian kernel density estimator with linear boundary bias corrections as found in the GetDist Python package. The column denoted as  $\mathcal{B}^{\mathrm{NL}}_{\mathrm{!NL}}$(Logspline) is the Bayes factor estimate when using the logspline density estimator. The $50$th percentile with the $5$th and $95$th percentiles in the plus and minus superscripts and subscripts, respectively.}\label{table:Bayes_sddr}
